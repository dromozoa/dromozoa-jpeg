<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Library compile-time options</h2>

<pre>
A number of compile-time options are available by modifying jmorecfg.h.

The IJG code currently supports 8-bit to 12-bit sample data precision by
defining BITS_IN_JSAMPLE as 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.
Note that a value larger than 8 causes JSAMPLE to be larger than a char,
so it affects the surrounding application's image data.
The sample applications cjpeg and djpeg can support deeper than 8-bit data
only for PPM and GIF file formats; you must disable the other file formats
to compile a 9-bit to 12-bit cjpeg or djpeg.  (install.txt has more
information about that.)
Run-time selection and conversion of data precision are currently not
supported and may be added later.
Exception:  The transcoding part (jpegtran) supports all settings in a
single instance, since it operates on the level of DCT coefficients and
not sample values.
(If you need to include an 8-bit library and a 9-bit to 12-bit library for
compression or decompression in a single application, you could probably do
it by defining NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES for just one of the copies.  You'd
have to access the 8-bit and the 9-bit to 12-bit copies from separate
application source files.  This is untested ... if you try it, we'd like to
hear whether it works!)

Note that the standard Huffman tables are only valid for 8-bit data precision.
If you selected more than 8-bit data precision, cjpeg uses arithmetic coding
by default.  The Huffman encoder normally uses entropy optimization to
compute usable tables for higher precision.  Otherwise, you'll have to
supply different default Huffman tables.  You may also want to supply your
own DCT quantization tables; the existing quality-scaling code has been
developed for 8-bit use, and probably doesn't generate especially good tables
for 9-bit to 12-bit.

The maximum number of components (color channels) in the image is determined
by MAX_COMPONENTS.  The JPEG standard allows up to 255 components, but we
expect that few applications will need more than four or so.

On machines with unusual data type sizes, you may be able to improve
performance or reduce memory space by tweaking the various typedefs in
jmorecfg.h.  In particular, on some RISC CPUs, access to arrays of "short"s
is quite slow; consider trading memory for speed by making JCOEF, INT16, and
UINT16 be "int" or "unsigned int".  UINT8 is also a candidate to become int.
You probably don't want to make JSAMPLE be int unless you have lots of memory
to burn.

You can reduce the size of the library by compiling out various optional
functions.  To do this, undefine xxx_SUPPORTED symbols as necessary.

You can also save a few K by not having text error messages in the library;
the standard error message table occupies about 5Kb.  This is particularly
reasonable for embedded applications where there's no good way to display 
a message anyway.  To do this, remove the creation of the message table
(jpeg_std_message_table[]) from jerror.c, and alter format_message to do
something reasonable without it.  You could output the numeric value of the
message code number, for example.  If you do this, you can also save a couple
more K by modifying the TRACEMSn() macros in jerror.h to expand to nothing;
you don't need trace capability anyway, right?
