<h1>BASIC LIBRARY USAGE</h1>

<h2>Decompression details</h2>

<pre>
Here we revisit the JPEG decompression outline given in the overview.

1. Allocate and initialize a JPEG decompression object.

This is just like initialization for compression, as discussed above,
except that the object is a "struct jpeg_decompress_struct" and you
call jpeg_create_decompress().  Error handling is exactly the same.

Typical code:

	struct jpeg_decompress_struct cinfo;
	struct jpeg_error_mgr jerr;
	...
	cinfo.err = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L948">jpeg_std_error</a>(&amp;jerr);
	jpeg_create_decompress(&amp;cinfo);

(Both here and in the IJG code, we usually use variable name "cinfo" for
both compression and decompression objects.)


2. Specify the source of the compressed data (eg, a file).

As previously mentioned, the JPEG library reads compressed data from a "data
source" module.  The library includes one data source module which knows how
to read from a stdio stream.  You can use your own source module if you want
to do something else, as discussed later.

If you use the standard source module, you must open the source stdio stream
beforehand.  Typical code for this step looks like:

	FILE * infile;
	...
	if ((infile = fopen(filename, "rb")) == NULL) {
	    fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s\n", filename);
	    exit(1);
	}
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L975">jpeg_stdio_src</a>(&amp;cinfo, infile);

where the last line invokes the standard source module.

WARNING: it is critical that the binary compressed data be read unchanged.
On non-Unix systems the stdio library may perform newline translation or
otherwise corrupt binary data.  To suppress this behavior, you may need to use
a "b" option to fopen (as shown above), or use setmode() or another routine to
put the stdio stream in binary mode.  See cjpeg.c and djpeg.c for code that
has been found to work on many systems.

You may not change the data source between calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() and
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>().  If you wish to read a series of JPEG images from
a single source file, you should repeat the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() to
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() sequence without reinitializing either the JPEG
object or the data source module; this prevents buffered input data from
being discarded.


3. Call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() to obtain image info.

Typical code for this step is just

	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(&amp;cinfo, TRUE);

This will read the source datastream header markers, up to the beginning
of the compressed data proper.  On return, the image dimensions and other
info have been stored in the JPEG object.  The application may wish to
consult this information before selecting decompression parameters.

More complex code is necessary if
  * A suspending data source is used --- in that case <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>()
    may return before it has read all the header data.  See "I/O suspension",
    below.  The normal stdio source manager will NOT cause this to happen.
  * Abbreviated JPEG files are to be processed --- see the section on
    abbreviated datastreams.  Standard applications that deal only in
    interchange JPEG files need not be concerned with this case either.

It is permissible to stop at this point if you just wanted to find out the
image dimensions and other header info for a JPEG file.  In that case,
call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>() when you are done with the JPEG object, or call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() to return it to an idle state before selecting a new data
source and reading another header.


4. Set parameters for decompression.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() sets appropriate default decompression parameters based on
the properties of the image (in particular, its colorspace).  However, you
may well want to alter these defaults before beginning the decompression.
For example, the default is to produce full color output from a color file.
If you want colormapped output you must ask for it.  Other options allow the
returned image to be scaled and allow various speed/quality tradeoffs to be
selected.  "Decompression parameter selection", below, gives details.

If the defaults are appropriate, nothing need be done at this step.

Note that all default values are set by each call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>().
If you reuse a decompression object, you cannot expect your parameter
settings to be preserved across cycles, as you can for compression.
You must set desired parameter values each time.


5. <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>(...);

Once the parameter values are satisfactory, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() to
begin decompression.  This will initialize internal state, allocate working
memory, and prepare for returning data.

Typical code is just

	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>(&amp;cinfo);

If you have requested a multi-pass operating mode, such as 2-pass color
quantization, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() will do everything needed before data
output can begin.  In this case <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() may take quite a while
to complete.  With a single-scan (non progressive) JPEG file and default
decompression parameters, this will not happen; <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() will
return quickly.

After this call, the final output image dimensions, including any requested
scaling, are available in the JPEG object; so is the selected colormap, if
colormapped output has been requested.  Useful fields include

	output_width		image width and height, as scaled
	output_height
	out_color_components	# of color components in out_color_space
	output_components	# of color components returned per pixel
	colormap		the selected colormap, if any
	actual_number_of_colors		number of entries in colormap

output_components is 1 (a colormap index) when quantizing colors; otherwise it
equals out_color_components.  It is the number of JSAMPLE values that will be
emitted per pixel in the output arrays.

Typically you will need to allocate data buffers to hold the incoming image.
You will need output_width * output_components JSAMPLEs per scanline in your
output buffer, and a total of output_height scanlines will be returned.

Note: if you are using the JPEG library's internal memory manager to allocate
data buffers (as djpeg does), then the manager's protocol requires that you
request large buffers *before* calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().  This is a
little tricky since the output_XXX fields are not normally valid then.  You
can make them valid by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1080">jpeg_calc_output_dimensions</a>() after setting the
relevant parameters (scaling, output color space, and quantization flag).


6. while (scan lines remain to be read)
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>(...);

Now you can read the decompressed image data by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>()
one or more times.  At each call, you pass in the maximum number of scanlines
to be read (ie, the height of your working buffer); <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>()
will return up to that many lines.  The return value is the number of lines
actually read.  The format of the returned data is discussed under "Data
formats", above.  Don't forget that grayscale and color JPEGs will return
different data formats!

Image data is returned in top-to-bottom scanline order.  If you must write
out the image in bottom-to-top order, you can use the JPEG library's virtual
array mechanism to invert the data efficiently.  Examples of this can be
found in the sample application djpeg.

The library maintains a count of the number of scanlines returned so far
in the output_scanline field of the JPEG object.  Usually you can just use
this variable as the loop counter, so that the loop test looks like
"while (cinfo.output_scanline &lt; cinfo.output_height)".  (Note that the test
should NOT be against image_height, unless you never use scaling.  The
image_height field is the height of the original unscaled image.)
The return value always equals the change in the value of output_scanline.

If you don't use a suspending data source, it is safe to assume that
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>() reads at least one scanline per call, until the
bottom of the image has been reached.

If you use a buffer larger than one scanline, it is NOT safe to assume that
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>() fills it.  (The current implementation returns only a
few scanlines per call, no matter how large a buffer you pass.)  So you must
always provide a loop that calls <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>() repeatedly until the
whole image has been read.


7. <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>(...);

After all the image data has been read, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() to
complete the decompression cycle.  This causes working memory associated
with the JPEG object to be released.

Typical code:

	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>(&amp;cinfo);

If using the stdio source manager, don't forget to close the source stdio
stream if necessary.

It is an error to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() before reading the correct
total number of scanlines.  If you wish to abort decompression, call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() as discussed below.

After completing a decompression cycle, you may dispose of the JPEG object as
discussed next, or you may use it to decompress another image.  In that case
return to step 2 or 3 as appropriate.  If you do not change the source
manager, the next image will be read from the same source.


8. Release the JPEG decompression object.

When you are done with a JPEG decompression object, destroy it by calling
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L970">jpeg_destroy_decompress</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>().  The previous discussion of
destroying compression objects applies here too.

Typical code:

	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L970">jpeg_destroy_decompress</a>(&amp;cinfo);


9. Aborting.

You can abort a decompression cycle by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L970">jpeg_destroy_decompress</a>() or
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>() if you don't need the JPEG object any more, or
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1106">jpeg_abort_decompress</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() if you want to reuse the object.
The previous discussion of aborting compression cycles applies here too.
