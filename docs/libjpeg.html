<pre>USING THE IJG JPEG LIBRARY

Copyright (C) 1994-2013, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.


This file describes how to use the IJG JPEG library within an application
program.  Read it if you want to write a program that uses the library.

The file example.c provides heavily commented skeleton code for calling the
JPEG library.  Also see jpeglib.h (the include file to be used by application
programs) for full details about data structures and function parameter lists.
The library source code, of course, is the ultimate reference.

Note that there have been *major* changes from the application interface
presented by IJG version 4 and earlier versions.  The old design had several
inherent limitations, and it had accumulated a lot of cruft as we added
features while trying to minimize application-interface changes.  We have
sacrificed backward compatibility in the version 5 rewrite, but we think the
improvements justify this.

to program with the library.  The sections on advanced features can be read
if and when you need them.
