<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Progressive JPEG support</h2>

<pre>
Progressive JPEG rearranges the stored data into a series of scans of
increasing quality.  In situations where a JPEG file is transmitted across a
slow communications link, a decoder can generate a low-quality image very
quickly from the first scan, then gradually improve the displayed quality as
more scans are received.  The final image after all scans are complete is
identical to that of a regular (sequential) JPEG file of the same quality
setting.  Progressive JPEG files are often slightly smaller than equivalent
sequential JPEG files, but the possibility of incremental display is the main
reason for using progressive JPEG.

The IJG encoder library generates progressive JPEG files when given a
suitable "scan script" defining how to divide the data into scans.
Creation of progressive JPEG files is otherwise transparent to the encoder.
Progressive JPEG files can also be read transparently by the decoder library.
If the decoding application simply uses the library as defined above, it
will receive a final decoded image without any indication that the file was
progressive.  Of course, this approach does not allow incremental display.
To perform incremental display, an application needs to use the decoder
library's "buffered-image" mode, in which it receives a decoded image
multiple times.

Each displayed scan requires about as much work to decode as a full JPEG
image of the same size, so the decoder must be fairly fast in relation to the
data transmission rate in order to make incremental display useful.  However,
it is possible to skip displaying the image and simply add the incoming bits
to the decoder's coefficient buffer.  This is fast because only Huffman
decoding need be done, not IDCT, upsampling, colorspace conversion, etc.
The IJG decoder library allows the application to switch dynamically between
displaying the image and simply absorbing the incoming bits.  A properly
coded application can automatically adapt the number of display passes to
suit the time available as the image is received.  Also, a final
higher-quality display cycle can be performed from the buffered data after
the end of the file is reached.

Progressive compression:

To create a progressive JPEG file (or a multiple-scan sequential JPEG file),
set the scan_info cinfo field to point to an array of scan descriptors, and
perform compression as usual.  Instead of constructing your own scan list,
you can call the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1003">jpeg_simple_progression</a>() helper routine to create a
recommended progression sequence; this method should be used by all
applications that don't want to get involved in the nitty-gritty of
progressive scan sequence design.  (If you want to provide user control of
scan sequences, you may wish to borrow the scan script reading code found
in rdswitch.c, so that you can read scan script files just like cjpeg's.)
When scan_info is not NULL, the compression library will store DCT'd data
into a buffer array as <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>() is called, and will emit all
the requested scans during <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>().  This implies that
multiple-scan output cannot be created with a suspending data destination
manager, since <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>() does not support suspension.  We
should also note that the compressor currently forces Huffman optimization
mode when creating a progressive JPEG file, because the default Huffman
tables are unsuitable for progressive files.

Progressive decompression:

When buffered-image mode is not used, the decoder library will read all of
a multi-scan file during <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>(), so that it can provide a
final decoded image.  (Here "multi-scan" means either progressive or
multi-scan sequential.)  This makes multi-scan files transparent to the
decoding application.  However, existing applications that used suspending
input with version 5 of the IJG library will need to be modified to check
for a suspension return from <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().

To perform incremental display, an application must use the library's
buffered-image mode.  This is described in the next section.
