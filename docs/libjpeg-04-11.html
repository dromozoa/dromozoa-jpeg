<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Raw (downsampled) image data</h2>

<pre>
Some applications need to supply already-downsampled image data to the JPEG
compressor, or to receive raw downsampled data from the decompressor.  The
library supports this requirement by allowing the application to write or
read raw data, bypassing the normal preprocessing or postprocessing steps.
The interface is different from the standard one and is somewhat harder to
use.  If your interest is merely in bypassing color conversion, we recommend
that you use the standard interface and simply set jpeg_color_space =
in_color_space (or jpeg_color_space = out_color_space for decompression).
The mechanism described in this section is necessary only to supply or
receive downsampled image data, in which not all components have the same
dimensions.


To compress raw data, you must supply the data in the colorspace to be used
in the JPEG file (please read the earlier section on Special color spaces)
and downsampled to the sampling factors specified in the JPEG parameters.
You must supply the data in the format used internally by the JPEG library,
namely a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L77">JSAMPIMAGE</a> array.  This is an array of pointers to two-dimensional
arrays, each of type <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L76">JSAMPARRAY</a>.  Each 2-D array holds the values for one
color component.  This structure is necessary since the components are of
different sizes.  If the image dimensions are not a multiple of the MCU size,
you must also pad the data correctly (usually, this is done by replicating
the last column and/or row).  The data must be padded to a multiple of a DCT
block in each component: that is, each downsampled row must contain a
multiple of block_size valid samples, and there must be a multiple of
block_size sample rows for each component.  (For applications such as
conversion of digital TV images, the standard image size is usually a
multiple of the DCT block size, so that no padding need actually be done.)

The procedure for compression of raw data is basically the same as normal
compression, except that you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a>() in place of
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>().  Before calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>(), you must do
the following:
  * Set cinfo-&gt;raw_data_in to TRUE.  (It is set FALSE by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>().)
    This notifies the library that you will be supplying raw data.
    Furthermore, set cinfo-&gt;do_fancy_downsampling to FALSE if you want to use
    real downsampled data.  (It is set TRUE by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>().)
  * Ensure jpeg_color_space is correct --- an explicit <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>()
    call is a good idea.  Note that since color conversion is bypassed,
    in_color_space is ignored, except that <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() uses it to
    choose the default jpeg_color_space setting.
  * Ensure the sampling factors, cinfo-&gt;comp_info[i].h_samp_factor and
    cinfo-&gt;comp_info[i].v_samp_factor, are correct.  Since these indicate the
    dimensions of the data you are supplying, it's wise to set them
    explicitly, rather than assuming the library's defaults are what you want.

To pass raw data to the library, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a>() in place of
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>().  The two routines work similarly except that
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a> takes a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L77">JSAMPIMAGE</a> data array rather than <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L76">JSAMPARRAY</a>.
The scanlines count passed to and returned from <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a> is
measured in terms of the component with the largest v_samp_factor.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a>() processes one MCU row per call, which is to say
v_samp_factor*block_size sample rows of each component.  The passed num_lines
value must be at least max_v_samp_factor*block_size, and the return value
will be exactly that amount (or possibly some multiple of that amount, in
future library versions).  This is true even on the last call at the bottom
of the image; don't forget to pad your data as necessary.

The required dimensions of the supplied data can be computed for each
component as
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[i].width_in_blocks*block_size  samples per row
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[i].height_in_blocks*block_size rows in image
after <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() has initialized those fields.  If the valid data
is smaller than this, it must be padded appropriately.  For some sampling
factors and image sizes, additional dummy DCT blocks are inserted to make
the image a multiple of the MCU dimensions.  The library creates such dummy
blocks itself; it does not read them from your supplied data.  Therefore you
need never pad by more than block_size samples.  An example may help here.
Assume 2h2v downsampling of YCbCr data, that is
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[0].h_samp_factor = 2		for Y
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[0].v_samp_factor = 2
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[1].h_samp_factor = 1		for Cb
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[1].v_samp_factor = 1
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[2].h_samp_factor = 1		for Cr
	cinfo-&gt;comp_info[2].v_samp_factor = 1
and suppose that the nominal image dimensions (cinfo-&gt;image_width and
cinfo-&gt;image_height) are 101x101 pixels.  Then <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() will
compute downsampled_width = 101 and width_in_blocks = 13 for Y,
downsampled_width = 51 and width_in_blocks = 7 for Cb and Cr (and the same
for the height fields).  You must pad the Y data to at least 13*8 = 104
columns and rows, the Cb/Cr data to at least 7*8 = 56 columns and rows.  The
MCU height is max_v_samp_factor = 2 DCT rows so you must pass at least 16
scanlines on each call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a>(), which is to say 16 actual
sample rows of Y and 8 each of Cb and Cr.  A total of 7 MCU rows are needed,
so you must pass a total of 7*16 = 112 "scanlines".  The last DCT block row
of Y data is dummy, so it doesn't matter what you pass for it in the data
arrays, but the scanlines count must total up to 112 so that all of the Cb
and Cr data gets passed.

Output suspension is supported with raw-data compression: if the data
destination module suspends, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1021">jpeg_write_raw_data</a>() will return 0.
In this case the same data rows must be passed again on the next call.


Decompression with raw data output implies bypassing all postprocessing.
You must deal with the color space and sampling factors present in the
incoming file.  If your application only handles, say, 2h1v YCbCr data,
you must check for and fail on other color spaces or other sampling factors.
The library will not convert to a different color space for you.

To obtain raw data output, set cinfo-&gt;raw_data_out = TRUE before
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() (it is set FALSE by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>()).  Be sure to
verify that the color space and sampling factors are ones you can handle.
Furthermore, set cinfo-&gt;do_fancy_upsampling = FALSE if you want to get real
downsampled data (it is set TRUE by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>()).
Then call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1059">jpeg_read_raw_data</a>() in place of <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>().  The
decompression process is otherwise the same as usual.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1059">jpeg_read_raw_data</a>() returns one MCU row per call, and thus you must pass a
buffer of at least max_v_samp_factor*block_size scanlines (scanline counting
is the same as for raw-data compression).  The buffer you pass must be large
enough to hold the actual data plus padding to DCT-block boundaries.  As with
compression, any entirely dummy DCT blocks are not processed so you need not
allocate space for them, but the total scanline count includes them.  The
above example of computing buffer dimensions for raw-data compression is
equally valid for decompression.

Input suspension is supported with raw-data decompression: if the data source
module suspends, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1059">jpeg_read_raw_data</a>() will return 0.  You can also use
buffered-image mode to read raw data in multiple passes.
