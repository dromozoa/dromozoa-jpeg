<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>

<h2>Outline of typical usage</h2>

<pre>
The rough outline of a JPEG compression operation is:

	Allocate and initialize a JPEG compression object
	Specify the destination for the compressed data (eg, a file)
	Set parameters for compression, including image size &amp; colorspace
	jpeg_start_compress(...);
	while (scan lines remain to be written)
		jpeg_write_scanlines(...);
	jpeg_finish_compress(...);
	Release the JPEG compression object

A JPEG compression object holds parameters and working state for the JPEG
library.  We make creation/destruction of the object separate from starting
or finishing compression of an image; the same object can be re-used for a
series of image compression operations.  This makes it easy to re-use the
same parameter settings for a sequence of images.  Re-use of a JPEG object
also has important implications for processing abbreviated JPEG datastreams,
as discussed later.

The image data to be compressed is supplied to jpeg_write_scanlines() from
in-memory buffers.  If the application is doing file-to-file compression,
reading image data from the source file is the application's responsibility.
The library emits compressed data by calling a "data destination manager",
which typically will write the data into a file; but the application can
provide its own destination manager to do something else.

Similarly, the rough outline of a JPEG decompression operation is:

	Allocate and initialize a JPEG decompression object
	Specify the source of the compressed data (eg, a file)
	Call jpeg_read_header() to obtain image info
	Set parameters for decompression
	jpeg_start_decompress(...);
	while (scan lines remain to be read)
		jpeg_read_scanlines(...);
	jpeg_finish_decompress(...);
	Release the JPEG decompression object

This is comparable to the compression outline except that reading the
datastream header is a separate step.  This is helpful because information
about the image's size, colorspace, etc is available when the application
selects decompression parameters.  For example, the application can choose an
output scaling ratio that will fit the image into the available screen size.

The decompression library obtains compressed data by calling a data source
manager, which typically will read the data from a file; but other behaviors
can be obtained with a custom source manager.  Decompressed data is delivered
into in-memory buffers passed to jpeg_read_scanlines().

It is possible to abort an incomplete compression or decompression operation
by calling jpeg_abort(); or, if you do not need to retain the JPEG object,
simply release it by calling jpeg_destroy().

JPEG compression and decompression objects are two separate struct types.
However, they share some common fields, and certain routines such as
jpeg_destroy() can work on either type of object.

The JPEG library has no static variables: all state is in the compression
or decompression object.  Therefore it is possible to process multiple
compression and decompression operations concurrently, using multiple JPEG
objects.

Both compression and decompression can be done in an incremental memory-to-
memory fashion, if suitable source/destination managers are used.  See the
section on "I/O suspension" for more details.
