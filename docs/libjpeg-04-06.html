<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>I/O suspension</h2>

<pre>
Some applications need to use the JPEG library as an incremental memory-to-
memory filter: when the compressed data buffer is filled or emptied, they want
control to return to the outer loop, rather than expecting that the buffer can
be emptied or reloaded within the data source/destination manager subroutine.
The library supports this need by providing an "I/O suspension" mode, which we
describe in this section.

The I/O suspension mode is not a panacea: nothing is guaranteed about the
maximum amount of time spent in any one call to the library, so it will not
eliminate response-time problems in single-threaded applications.  If you
need guaranteed response time, we suggest you "bite the bullet" and implement
a real multi-tasking capability.

To use I/O suspension, cooperation is needed between the calling application
and the data source or destination manager; you will always need a custom
source/destination manager.  (Please read the previous section if you haven't
already.)  The basic idea is that the empty_output_buffer() or
fill_input_buffer() routine is a no-op, merely returning FALSE to indicate
that it has done nothing.  Upon seeing this, the JPEG library suspends
operation and returns to its caller.  The surrounding application is
responsible for emptying or refilling the work buffer before calling the
JPEG library again.

Compression suspension:

For compression suspension, use an empty_output_buffer() routine that returns
FALSE; typically it will not do anything else.  This will cause the
compressor to return to the caller of <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>(), with the return
value indicating that not all the supplied scanlines have been accepted.
The application must make more room in the output buffer, adjust the output
buffer pointer/count appropriately, and then call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>()
again, pointing to the first unconsumed scanline.

When forced to suspend, the compressor will backtrack to a convenient stopping
point (usually the start of the current MCU); it will regenerate some output
data when restarted.  Therefore, although empty_output_buffer() is only
called when the buffer is filled, you should NOT write out the entire buffer
after a suspension.  Write only the data up to the current position of
next_output_byte/free_in_buffer.  The data beyond that point will be
regenerated after resumption.

Because of the backtracking behavior, a good-size output buffer is essential
for efficiency; you don't want the compressor to suspend often.  (In fact, an
overly small buffer could lead to infinite looping, if a single MCU required
more data than would fit in the buffer.)  We recommend a buffer of at least
several Kbytes.  You may want to insert explicit code to ensure that you don't
call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>() unless there is a reasonable amount of space in
the output buffer; in other words, flush the buffer before trying to compress
more data.

The compressor does not allow suspension while it is trying to write JPEG
markers at the beginning and end of the file.  This means that:
  * At the beginning of a compression operation, there must be enough free
    space in the output buffer to hold the header markers (typically 600 or
    so bytes).  The recommended buffer size is bigger than this anyway, so
    this is not a problem as long as you start with an empty buffer.  However,
    this restriction might catch you if you insert large special markers, such
    as a JFIF thumbnail image, without flushing the buffer afterwards.
  * When you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>(), there must be enough space in the
    output buffer to emit any buffered data and the final EOI marker.  In the
    current implementation, half a dozen bytes should suffice for this, but
    for safety's sake we recommend ensuring that at least 100 bytes are free
    before calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>().

A more significant restriction is that <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>() cannot suspend.
This means you cannot use suspension with multi-pass operating modes, namely
Huffman code optimization and multiple-scan output.  Those modes write the
whole file during <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>(), which will certainly result in
buffer overrun.  (Note that this restriction applies only to compression,
not decompression.  The decompressor supports input suspension in all of its
operating modes.)

Decompression suspension:

For decompression suspension, use a fill_input_buffer() routine that simply
returns FALSE (except perhaps during error recovery, as discussed below).
This will cause the decompressor to return to its caller with an indication
that suspension has occurred.  This can happen at four places:
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(): will return JPEG_SUSPENDED.
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>(): will return FALSE, rather than its usual TRUE.
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>(): will return the number of scanlines already
	completed (possibly 0).
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>(): will return FALSE, rather than its usual TRUE.
The surrounding application must recognize these cases, load more data into
the input buffer, and repeat the call.  In the case of <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>(),
increment the passed pointers past any scanlines successfully read.

Just as with compression, the decompressor will typically backtrack to a
convenient restart point before suspending.  When fill_input_buffer() is
called, next_input_byte/bytes_in_buffer point to the current restart point,
which is where the decompressor will backtrack to if FALSE is returned.
The data beyond that position must NOT be discarded if you suspend; it needs
to be re-read upon resumption.  In most implementations, you'll need to shift
this data down to the start of your work buffer and then load more data after
it.  Again, this behavior means that a several-Kbyte work buffer is essential
for decent performance; furthermore, you should load a reasonable amount of
new data before resuming decompression.  (If you loaded, say, only one new
byte each time around, you could waste a LOT of cycles.)

The skip_input_data() source manager routine requires special care in a
suspension scenario.  This routine is NOT granted the ability to suspend the
decompressor; it can decrement bytes_in_buffer to zero, but no more.  If the
requested skip distance exceeds the amount of data currently in the input
buffer, then skip_input_data() must set bytes_in_buffer to zero and record the
additional skip distance somewhere else.  The decompressor will immediately
call fill_input_buffer(), which should return FALSE, which will cause a
suspension return.  The surrounding application must then arrange to discard
the recorded number of bytes before it resumes loading the input buffer.
(Yes, this design is rather baroque, but it avoids complexity in the far more
common case where a non-suspending source manager is used.)

If the input data has been exhausted, we recommend that you emit a warning
and insert dummy EOI markers just as a non-suspending data source manager
would do.  This can be handled either in the surrounding application logic or
within fill_input_buffer(); the latter is probably more efficient.  If
fill_input_buffer() knows that no more data is available, it can set the
pointer/count to point to a dummy EOI marker and then return TRUE just as
though it had read more data in a non-suspending situation.

The decompressor does not attempt to suspend within standard JPEG markers;
instead it will backtrack to the start of the marker and reprocess the whole
marker next time.  Hence the input buffer must be large enough to hold the
longest standard marker in the file.  Standard JPEG markers should normally
not exceed a few hundred bytes each (DHT tables are typically the longest).
We recommend at least a 2K buffer for performance reasons, which is much
larger than any correct marker is likely to be.  For robustness against
damaged marker length counts, you may wish to insert a test in your
application for the case that the input buffer is completely full and yet
the decoder has suspended without consuming any data --- otherwise, if this
situation did occur, it would lead to an endless loop.  (The library can't
provide this test since it has no idea whether "the buffer is full", or
even whether there is a fixed-size input buffer.)

The input buffer would need to be 64K to allow for arbitrary COM or APPn
markers, but these are handled specially: they are either saved into allocated
memory, or skipped over by calling skip_input_data().  In the former case,
suspension is handled correctly, and in the latter case, the problem of
buffer overrun is placed on skip_input_data's shoulders, as explained above.
Note that if you provide your own marker handling routine for large markers,
you should consider how to deal with buffer overflow.

Multiple-buffer management:

In some applications it is desirable to store the compressed data in a linked
list of buffer areas, so as to avoid data copying.  This can be handled by
having empty_output_buffer() or fill_input_buffer() set the pointer and count
to reference the next available buffer; FALSE is returned only if no more
buffers are available.  Although seemingly straightforward, there is a
pitfall in this approach: the backtrack that occurs when FALSE is returned
could back up into an earlier buffer.  For example, when fill_input_buffer()
is called, the current pointer &amp; count indicate the backtrack restart point.
Since fill_input_buffer() will set the pointer and count to refer to a new
buffer, the restart position must be saved somewhere else.  Suppose a second
call to fill_input_buffer() occurs in the same library call, and no
additional input data is available, so fill_input_buffer must return FALSE.
If the JPEG library has not moved the pointer/count forward in the current
buffer, then *the correct restart point is the saved position in the prior
buffer*.  Prior buffers may be discarded only after the library establishes
a restart point within a later buffer.  Similar remarks apply for output into
a chain of buffers.

The library will never attempt to backtrack over a skip_input_data() call,
so any skipped data can be permanently discarded.  You still have to deal
with the case of skipping not-yet-received data, however.

It's much simpler to use only a single buffer; when fill_input_buffer() is
called, move any unconsumed data (beyond the current pointer/count) down to
the beginning of this buffer and then load new data into the remaining buffer
space.  This approach requires a little more data copying but is far easier
to get right.
