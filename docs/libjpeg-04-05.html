<h2>Compressed data handling (source and destination managers)</h2>

<pre>
The JPEG compression library sends its compressed data to a "destination
manager" module.  The default destination manager just writes the data to a
memory buffer or to a stdio stream, but you can provide your own manager to
do something else.  Similarly, the decompression library calls a "source
manager" to obtain the compressed data; you can provide your own source
manager if you want the data to come from somewhere other than a memory
buffer or a stdio stream.

In both cases, compressed data is processed a bufferload at a time: the
destination or source manager provides a work buffer, and the library invokes
the manager only when the buffer is filled or emptied.  (You could define a
one-character buffer to force the manager to be invoked for each byte, but
that would be rather inefficient.)  The buffer's size and location are
controlled by the manager, not by the library.  For example, the memory
source manager just makes the buffer pointer and length point to the original
data in memory.  In this case the buffer-reload procedure will be invoked
only if the decompressor ran off the end of the datastream, which would
indicate an erroneous datastream.

The work buffer is defined as an array of datatype JOCTET, which is generally
"char" or "unsigned char".  On a machine where char is not exactly 8 bits
wide, you must define JOCTET as a wider data type and then modify the data
source and destination modules to transcribe the work arrays into 8-bit units
on external storage.

A data destination manager struct contains a pointer and count defining the
next byte to write in the work buffer and the remaining free space:

	JOCTET * next_output_byte;  /* =&gt; next byte to write in buffer */
	size_t free_in_buffer;      /* # of byte spaces remaining in buffer */

The library increments the pointer and decrements the count until the buffer
is filled.  The manager's empty_output_buffer method must reset the pointer
and count.  The manager is expected to remember the buffer's starting address
and total size in private fields not visible to the library.

A data destination manager provides three methods:

init_destination (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Initialize destination.  This is called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>()
	before any data is actually written.  It must initialize
	next_output_byte and free_in_buffer.  free_in_buffer must be
	initialized to a positive value.

empty_output_buffer (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	This is called whenever the buffer has filled (free_in_buffer
	reaches zero).  In typical applications, it should write out the
	*entire* buffer (use the saved start address and buffer length;
	ignore the current state of next_output_byte and free_in_buffer).
	Then reset the pointer &amp; count to the start of the buffer, and
	return TRUE indicating that the buffer has been dumped.
	free_in_buffer must be set to a positive value when TRUE is
	returned.  A FALSE return should only be used when I/O suspension is
	desired (this operating mode is discussed in the next section).

term_destination (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Terminate destination --- called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>() after all
	data has been written.  In most applications, this must flush any
	data remaining in the buffer.  Use either next_output_byte or
	free_in_buffer to determine how much data is in the buffer.

term_destination() is NOT called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>().  If you
want the destination manager to be cleaned up during an abort, you must do it
yourself.

You will also need code to create a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L772">jpeg_destination_mgr</a> struct, fill in its
method pointers, and insert a pointer to the struct into the "dest" field of
the JPEG compression object.  This can be done in-line in your setup code if
you like, but it's probably cleaner to provide a separate routine similar to
the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L974">jpeg_stdio_dest</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L978">jpeg_mem_dest</a>() routines of the supplied destination
managers.

Decompression source managers follow a parallel design, but with some
additional frammishes.  The source manager struct contains a pointer and count
defining the next byte to read from the work buffer and the number of bytes
remaining:

	const JOCTET * next_input_byte; /* =&gt; next byte to read from buffer */
	size_t bytes_in_buffer;         /* # of bytes remaining in buffer */

The library increments the pointer and decrements the count until the buffer
is emptied.  The manager's fill_input_buffer method must reset the pointer and
count.  In most applications, the manager must remember the buffer's starting
address and total size in private fields not visible to the library.

A data source manager provides five methods:

init_source (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Initialize source.  This is called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() before any
	data is actually read.  Unlike init_destination(), it may leave
	bytes_in_buffer set to 0 (in which case a fill_input_buffer() call
	will occur immediately).

fill_input_buffer (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	This is called whenever bytes_in_buffer has reached zero and more
	data is wanted.  In typical applications, it should read fresh data
	into the buffer (ignoring the current state of next_input_byte and
	bytes_in_buffer), reset the pointer &amp; count to the start of the
	buffer, and return TRUE indicating that the buffer has been reloaded.
	It is not necessary to fill the buffer entirely, only to obtain at
	least one more byte.  bytes_in_buffer MUST be set to a positive value
	if TRUE is returned.  A FALSE return should only be used when I/O
	suspension is desired (this mode is discussed in the next section).

skip_input_data (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo, long num_bytes)
	Skip num_bytes worth of data.  The buffer pointer and count should
	be advanced over num_bytes input bytes, refilling the buffer as
	needed.  This is used to skip over a potentially large amount of
	uninteresting data (such as an APPn marker).  In some applications
	it may be possible to optimize away the reading of the skipped data,
	but it's not clear that being smart is worth much trouble; large
	skips are uncommon.  bytes_in_buffer may be zero on return.
	A zero or negative skip count should be treated as a no-op.

resync_to_restart (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo, int desired)
	This routine is called only when the decompressor has failed to find
	a restart (RSTn) marker where one is expected.  Its mission is to
	find a suitable point for resuming decompression.  For most
	applications, we recommend that you just use the default resync
	procedure, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1115">jpeg_resync_to_restart</a>().  However, if you are able to back
	up in the input data stream, or if you have a-priori knowledge about
	the likely location of restart markers, you may be able to do better.
	Read the read_restart_marker() and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1115">jpeg_resync_to_restart</a>() routines
	in jdmarker.c if you think you'd like to implement your own resync
	procedure.

term_source (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Terminate source --- called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() after all
	data has been read.  Often a no-op.

For both fill_input_buffer() and skip_input_data(), there is no such thing
as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been reached, the routine has
a choice of exiting via ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into the buffer.
In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a fake EOI marker
is the best course of action --- this will allow the decompressor to output
however much of the image is there.  In pathological cases, the decompressor
may swallow the EOI and again demand data ... just keep feeding it fake EOIs.
jdatasrc.c illustrates the recommended error recovery behavior.

term_source() is NOT called by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>().  If you want
the source manager to be cleaned up during an abort, you must do it yourself.

You will also need code to create a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L784">jpeg_source_mgr</a> struct, fill in its method
pointers, and insert a pointer to the struct into the "src" field of the JPEG
decompression object.  This can be done in-line in your setup code if you
like, but it's probably cleaner to provide a separate routine similar to the
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L975">jpeg_stdio_src</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L981">jpeg_mem_src</a>() routines of the supplied source managers.

managers in jdatasrc.c and jdatadst.c.
