<h1>BASIC LIBRARY USAGE</h1>

<h2>Compression details</h2>

<pre>
Here we revisit the JPEG compression outline given in the overview.

1. Allocate and initialize a JPEG compression object.

A JPEG compression object is a "struct jpeg_compress_struct".  (It also has
a bunch of subsidiary structures which are allocated via malloc(), but the
application doesn't control those directly.)  This struct can be just a local
variable in the calling routine, if a single routine is going to execute the
whole JPEG compression sequence.  Otherwise it can be static or allocated
from malloc().

You will also need a structure representing a JPEG error handler.  The part
of this that the library cares about is a "struct jpeg_error_mgr".  If you
are providing your own error handler, you'll typically want to embed the
jpeg_error_mgr struct in a larger structure; this is discussed later under
"Error handling".  For now we'll assume you are just using the default error
handler.  The default error handler will print JPEG error/warning messages
on stderr, and it will call exit() if a fatal error occurs.

You must initialize the error handler structure, store a pointer to it into
the JPEG object's "err" field, and then call jpeg_create_compress() to
initialize the rest of the JPEG object.

Typical code for this step, if you are using the default error handler, is

	struct jpeg_compress_struct cinfo;
	struct jpeg_error_mgr jerr;
	...
	cinfo.err = jpeg_std_error(&amp;jerr);
	jpeg_create_compress(&amp;cinfo);

jpeg_create_compress allocates a small amount of memory, so it could fail
if you are out of memory.  In that case it will exit via the error handler;
that's why the error handler must be initialized first.


2. Specify the destination for the compressed data (eg, a file).

As previously mentioned, the JPEG library delivers compressed data to a
"data destination" module.  The library includes one data destination
module which knows how to write to a stdio stream.  You can use your own
destination module if you want to do something else, as discussed later.

If you use the standard destination module, you must open the target stdio
stream beforehand.  Typical code for this step looks like:

	FILE * outfile;
	...
	if ((outfile = fopen(filename, "wb")) == NULL) {
	    fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s\n", filename);
	    exit(1);
	}
	jpeg_stdio_dest(&amp;cinfo, outfile);

where the last line invokes the standard destination module.

WARNING: it is critical that the binary compressed data be delivered to the
output file unchanged.  On non-Unix systems the stdio library may perform
newline translation or otherwise corrupt binary data.  To suppress this
behavior, you may need to use a "b" option to fopen (as shown above), or use
setmode() or another routine to put the stdio stream in binary mode.  See
cjpeg.c and djpeg.c for code that has been found to work on many systems.

You can select the data destination after setting other parameters (step 3),
if that's more convenient.  You may not change the destination between
calling jpeg_start_compress() and jpeg_finish_compress().


3. Set parameters for compression, including image size &amp; colorspace.

You must supply information about the source image by setting the following
fields in the JPEG object (cinfo structure):

	image_width		Width of image, in pixels
	image_height		Height of image, in pixels
	input_components	Number of color channels (samples per pixel)
	in_color_space		Color space of source image

The image dimensions are, hopefully, obvious.  JPEG supports image dimensions
of 1 to 64K pixels in either direction.  The input color space is typically
RGB or grayscale, and input_components is 3 or 1 accordingly.  (See "Special
color spaces", later, for more info.)  The in_color_space field must be
assigned one of the J_COLOR_SPACE enum constants, typically JCS_RGB or
JCS_GRAYSCALE.

JPEG has a large number of compression parameters that determine how the
image is encoded.  Most applications don't need or want to know about all
these parameters.  You can set all the parameters to reasonable defaults by
calling jpeg_set_defaults(); then, if there are particular values you want
to change, you can do so after that.  The "Compression parameter selection"
section tells about all the parameters.

You must set in_color_space correctly before calling jpeg_set_defaults(),
because the defaults depend on the source image colorspace.  However the
other three source image parameters need not be valid until you call
jpeg_start_compress().  There's no harm in calling jpeg_set_defaults() more
than once, if that happens to be convenient.

Typical code for a 24-bit RGB source image is

	cinfo.image_width = Width; 	/* image width and height, in pixels */
	cinfo.image_height = Height;
	cinfo.input_components = 3;	/* # of color components per pixel */
	cinfo.in_color_space = JCS_RGB; /* colorspace of input image */

	jpeg_set_defaults(&amp;cinfo);
	/* Make optional parameter settings here */


4. jpeg_start_compress(...);

After you have established the data destination and set all the necessary
source image info and other parameters, call jpeg_start_compress() to begin
a compression cycle.  This will initialize internal state, allocate working
storage, and emit the first few bytes of the JPEG datastream header.

Typical code:

	jpeg_start_compress(&amp;cinfo, TRUE);

The "TRUE" parameter ensures that a complete JPEG interchange datastream
will be written.  This is appropriate in most cases.  If you think you might
want to use an abbreviated datastream, read the section on abbreviated
datastreams, below.

Once you have called jpeg_start_compress(), you may not alter any JPEG
parameters or other fields of the JPEG object until you have completed
the compression cycle.


5. while (scan lines remain to be written)
	jpeg_write_scanlines(...);

Now write all the required image data by calling jpeg_write_scanlines()
one or more times.  You can pass one or more scanlines in each call, up
to the total image height.  In most applications it is convenient to pass
just one or a few scanlines at a time.  The expected format for the passed
data is discussed under "Data formats", above.

Image data should be written in top-to-bottom scanline order.  The JPEG spec
contains some weasel wording about how top and bottom are application-defined
terms (a curious interpretation of the English language...) but if you want
your files to be compatible with everyone else's, you WILL use top-to-bottom
order.  If the source data must be read in bottom-to-top order, you can use
the JPEG library's virtual array mechanism to invert the data efficiently.
Examples of this can be found in the sample application cjpeg.

The library maintains a count of the number of scanlines written so far
in the next_scanline field of the JPEG object.  Usually you can just use
this variable as the loop counter, so that the loop test looks like
"while (cinfo.next_scanline &lt; cinfo.image_height)".

Code for this step depends heavily on the way that you store the source data.
example.c shows the following code for the case of a full-size 2-D source
array containing 3-byte RGB pixels:

	JSAMPROW row_pointer[1];	/* pointer to a single row */
	int row_stride;			/* physical row width in buffer */

	row_stride = image_width * 3;	/* JSAMPLEs per row in image_buffer */

	while (cinfo.next_scanline &lt; cinfo.image_height) {
	    row_pointer[0] = &amp; image_buffer[cinfo.next_scanline * row_stride];
	    jpeg_write_scanlines(&amp;cinfo, row_pointer, 1);
	}

jpeg_write_scanlines() returns the number of scanlines actually written.
This will normally be equal to the number passed in, so you can usually
ignore the return value.  It is different in just two cases:
  * If you try to write more scanlines than the declared image height,
    the additional scanlines are ignored.
  * If you use a suspending data destination manager, output buffer overrun
    will cause the compressor to return before accepting all the passed lines.
    This feature is discussed under "I/O suspension", below.  The normal
    stdio destination manager will NOT cause this to happen.
In any case, the return value is the same as the change in the value of
next_scanline.


6. jpeg_finish_compress(...);

After all the image data has been written, call jpeg_finish_compress() to
complete the compression cycle.  This step is ESSENTIAL to ensure that the
last bufferload of data is written to the data destination.
jpeg_finish_compress() also releases working memory associated with the JPEG
object.

Typical code:

	jpeg_finish_compress(&amp;cinfo);

If using the stdio destination manager, don't forget to close the output
stdio stream (if necessary) afterwards.

If you have requested a multi-pass operating mode, such as Huffman code
optimization, jpeg_finish_compress() will perform the additional passes using
data buffered by the first pass.  In this case jpeg_finish_compress() may take
quite a while to complete.  With the default compression parameters, this will
not happen.

It is an error to call jpeg_finish_compress() before writing the necessary
total number of scanlines.  If you wish to abort compression, call
jpeg_abort() as discussed below.

After completing a compression cycle, you may dispose of the JPEG object
as discussed next, or you may use it to compress another image.  In that case
return to step 2, 3, or 4 as appropriate.  If you do not change the
destination manager, the new datastream will be written to the same target.
If you do not change any JPEG parameters, the new datastream will be written
with the same parameters as before.  Note that you can change the input image
dimensions freely between cycles, but if you change the input colorspace, you
should call jpeg_set_defaults() to adjust for the new colorspace; and then
you'll need to repeat all of step 3.


7. Release the JPEG compression object.

When you are done with a JPEG compression object, destroy it by calling
jpeg_destroy_compress().  This will free all subsidiary memory (regardless of
the previous state of the object).  Or you can call jpeg_destroy(), which
works for either compression or decompression objects --- this may be more
convenient if you are sharing code between compression and decompression
cases.  (Actually, these routines are equivalent except for the declared type
of the passed pointer.  To avoid gripes from ANSI C compilers, jpeg_destroy()
should be passed a j_common_ptr.)

If you allocated the jpeg_compress_struct structure from malloc(), freeing
it is your responsibility --- jpeg_destroy() won't.  Ditto for the error
handler structure.

Typical code:

	jpeg_destroy_compress(&amp;cinfo);


8. Aborting.

If you decide to abort a compression cycle before finishing, you can clean up
in either of two ways:

* If you don't need the JPEG object any more, just call
  jpeg_destroy_compress() or jpeg_destroy() to release memory.  This is
  legitimate at any point after calling jpeg_create_compress() --- in fact,
  it's safe even if jpeg_create_compress() fails.

* If you want to re-use the JPEG object, call jpeg_abort_compress(), or call
  jpeg_abort() which works on both compression and decompression objects.
  This will return the object to an idle state, releasing any working memory.
  jpeg_abort() is allowed at any time after successful object creation.

Note that cleaning up the data destination, if required, is your
responsibility; neither of these routines will call term_destination().
(See "Compressed data handling", below, for more about that.)

jpeg_destroy() and jpeg_abort() are the only safe calls to make on a JPEG
object that has reported an error by calling error_exit (see "Error handling"
for more info).  The internal state of such an object is likely to be out of
whack.  Either of these two routines will return the object to a known state.
