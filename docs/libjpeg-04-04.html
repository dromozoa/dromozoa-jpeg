<h2>Error handling</h2>

<pre>
When the default error handler is used, any error detected inside the JPEG
routines will cause a message to be printed on stderr, followed by exit().
You can supply your own error handling routines to override this behavior
and to control the treatment of nonfatal warnings and trace/debug messages.
The file example.c illustrates the most common case, which is to have the
application regain control after an error rather than exiting.

The JPEG library never writes any message directly; it always goes through
the error handling routines.  Three classes of messages are recognized:
  * Fatal errors: the library cannot continue.
  * Warnings: the library can continue, but the data is corrupt, and a
    damaged output image is likely to result.
  * Trace/informational messages.  These come with a trace level indicating
    the importance of the message; you can control the verbosity of the
    program by adjusting the maximum trace level that will be displayed.

You may, if you wish, simply replace the entire JPEG error handling module
(jerror.c) with your own code.  However, you can avoid code duplication by
only replacing some of the routines depending on the behavior you need.
This is accomplished by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L948">jpeg_std_error</a>() as usual, but then overriding
some of the method pointers in the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L702">jpeg_error_mgr</a> struct, as illustrated by
example.c.

All of the error handling routines will receive a pointer to the JPEG object
(a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a> which points to either a <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L291">jpeg_compress_struct</a> or a
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L459">jpeg_decompress_struct</a>; if you need to tell which, test the is_decompressor
field).  This struct includes a pointer to the error manager struct in its
"err" field.  Frequently, custom error handler routines will need to access
additional data which is not known to the JPEG library or the standard error
handler.  The most convenient way to do this is to embed either the JPEG
object or the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L702">jpeg_error_mgr</a> struct in a larger structure that contains
additional fields; then casting the passed pointer provides access to the
additional fields.  Again, see example.c for one way to do it.  (Beginning
with IJG version 6b, there is also a void pointer "client_data" in each
JPEG object, which the application can also use to find related data.
The library does not touch client_data at all.)

The individual methods that you might wish to override are:

error_exit (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Receives control for a fatal error.  Information sufficient to
	generate the error message has been stored in cinfo-&gt;err; call
	output_message to display it.  Control must NOT return to the caller;
	generally this routine will exit() or longjmp() somewhere.
	Typically you would override this routine to get rid of the exit()
	default behavior.  Note that if you continue processing, you should
	clean up the JPEG object with <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>().

output_message (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Actual output of any JPEG message.  Override this to send messages
	somewhere other than stderr.  Note that this method does not know
	how to generate a message, only where to send it.

format_message (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a> cinfo, char * buffer)
	Constructs a readable error message string based on the error info
	stored in cinfo-&gt;err.  This method is called by output_message.  Few
	applications should need to override this method.  One possible
	reason for doing so is to implement dynamic switching of error message
	language.

emit_message (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a> cinfo, int msg_level)
	Decide whether or not to emit a warning or trace message; if so,
	calls output_message.  The main reason for overriding this method
	would be to abort on warnings.  msg_level is -1 for warnings,
	0 and up for trace messages.

Only error_exit() and emit_message() are called from the rest of the JPEG
library; the other two are internal to the error handler.

The actual message texts are stored in an array of strings which is pointed to
by the field err-&gt;jpeg_message_table.  The messages are numbered from 0 to
err-&gt;last_jpeg_message, and it is these code numbers that are used in the
JPEG library code.  You could replace the message texts (for instance, with
messages in French or German) by changing the message table pointer.  See
jerror.h for the default texts.  CAUTION: this table will almost certainly
change or grow from one library version to the next.

It may be useful for an application to add its own message texts that are
handled by the same mechanism.  The error handler supports a second "add-on"
message table for this purpose.  To define an addon table, set the pointer
err-&gt;addon_message_table and the message numbers err-&gt;first_addon_message and
err-&gt;last_addon_message.  If you number the addon messages beginning at 1000
or so, you won't have to worry about conflicts with the library's built-in
messages.  See the sample applications cjpeg/djpeg for an example of using
addon messages (the addon messages are defined in cderror.h).

Actual invocation of the error handler is done via macros defined in jerror.h:
	ERREXITn(...)	for fatal errors
	WARNMSn(...)	for corrupt-data warnings
	TRACEMSn(...)	for trace and informational messages.
These macros store the message code and any additional parameters into the
error handler struct, then invoke the error_exit() or emit_message() method.
The variants of each macro are for varying numbers of additional parameters.
The additional parameters are inserted into the generated message using
standard printf() format codes.

See jerror.h and jerror.c for further details.
