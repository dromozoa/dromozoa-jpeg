<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Memory usage</h2>

<pre>
Working memory requirements while performing compression or decompression
depend on image dimensions, image characteristics (such as colorspace and
JPEG process), and operating mode (application-selected options).

As of v6b, the decompressor requires:
 1. About 24K in more-or-less-fixed-size data.  This varies a bit depending
    on operating mode and image characteristics (particularly color vs.
    grayscale), but it doesn't depend on image dimensions.
 2. Strip buffers (of size proportional to the image width) for IDCT and
    upsampling results.  The worst case for commonly used sampling factors
    is about 34 bytes * width in pixels for a color image.  A grayscale image
    only needs about 8 bytes per pixel column.
 3. A full-image DCT coefficient buffer is needed to decode a multi-scan JPEG
    file (including progressive JPEGs), or whenever you select buffered-image
    mode.  This takes 2 bytes/coefficient.  At typical 2x2 sampling, that's
    3 bytes per pixel for a color image.  Worst case (1x1 sampling) requires
    6 bytes/pixel.  For grayscale, figure 2 bytes/pixel.
 4. To perform 2-pass color quantization, the decompressor also needs a
    128K color lookup table and a full-image pixel buffer (3 bytes/pixel).
This does not count any memory allocated by the application, such as a
buffer to hold the final output image.

The above figures are valid for 8-bit JPEG data precision and a machine with
32-bit ints.  For 9-bit to 12-bit JPEG data, double the size of the strip
buffers and quantization pixel buffer.  The "fixed-size" data will be
somewhat smaller with 16-bit ints, larger with 64-bit ints.  Also, CMYK
or other unusual color spaces will require different amounts of space.

The full-image coefficient and pixel buffers, if needed at all, do not
have to be fully RAM resident; you can have the library use temporary
files instead when the total memory usage would exceed a limit you set.
(But if your OS supports virtual memory, it's probably better to just use
jmemnobs and let the OS do the swapping.)

The compressor's memory requirements are similar, except that it has no need
for color quantization.  Also, it needs a full-image DCT coefficient buffer
if Huffman-table optimization is asked for, even if progressive mode is not
requested.

If you need more detailed information about memory usage in a particular
situation, you can enable the MEM_STATS code in jmemmgr.c.
