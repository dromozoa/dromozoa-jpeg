<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Decompression parameter selection</h2>

<pre>
Decompression parameter selection is somewhat simpler than compression
parameter selection, since all of the JPEG internal parameters are
recorded in the source file and need not be supplied by the application.
(Unless you are working with abbreviated files, in which case see
"Abbreviated datastreams", below.)  Decompression parameters control
the postprocessing done on the image to deliver it in a format suitable
for the application's use.  Many of the parameters control speed/quality
tradeoffs, in which faster decompression may be obtained at the price of
a poorer-quality image.  The defaults select the highest quality (slowest)
processing.

The following fields in the JPEG object are set by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() and
may be useful to the application in choosing decompression parameters:

JDIMENSION image_width			Width and height of image
JDIMENSION image_height
int num_components			Number of color components
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L229">J_COLOR_SPACE</a> jpeg_color_space		Colorspace of image
boolean saw_JFIF_marker			TRUE if a JFIF APP0 marker was seen
  UINT8 JFIF_major_version		Version information from JFIF marker
  UINT8 JFIF_minor_version
  UINT8 density_unit			Resolution data from JFIF marker
  UINT16 X_density
  UINT16 Y_density
boolean saw_Adobe_marker		TRUE if an Adobe APP14 marker was seen
  UINT8 Adobe_transform			Color transform code from Adobe marker

The JPEG color space, unfortunately, is something of a guess since the JPEG
standard proper does not provide a way to record it.  In practice most files
adhere to the JFIF or Adobe conventions, and the decoder will recognize these
correctly.  See "Special color spaces", below, for more info.


The decompression parameters that determine the basic properties of the
returned image are:

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L229">J_COLOR_SPACE</a> out_color_space
	Output color space.  <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() sets an appropriate default
	based on jpeg_color_space; typically it will be RGB or grayscale.
	The application can change this field to request output in a different
	colorspace.  For example, set it to JCS_GRAYSCALE to get grayscale
	output from a color file.  (This is useful for previewing: grayscale
	output is faster than full color since the color components need not
	be processed.)  Note that not all possible color space transforms are
	currently implemented; you may need to extend jdcolor.c if you want an
	unusual conversion.

unsigned int scale_num, scale_denom
	Scale the image by the fraction scale_num/scale_denom.  Currently,
	the supported scaling ratios are M/N with all M from 1 to 16, where
	N is the source DCT size, which is 8 for baseline JPEG.  (The library
	design allows for arbitrary scaling ratios but this is not likely
	to be implemented any time soon.)  The values are initialized by
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() with the source DCT size.  For baseline JPEG
	this is 8/8.  If you change only the scale_num value while leaving
	the other unchanged, then this specifies the DCT scaled size to be
	applied on the given input.  For baseline JPEG this is equivalent
	to M/8 scaling, since the source DCT size for baseline JPEG is 8.
	Smaller scaling ratios permit significantly faster decoding since
	fewer pixels need be processed and a simpler IDCT method can be used.

boolean quantize_colors
	If set TRUE, colormapped output will be delivered.  Default is FALSE,
	meaning that full-color output will be delivered.

The next three parameters are relevant only if quantize_colors is TRUE.

int desired_number_of_colors
	Maximum number of colors to use in generating a library-supplied color
	map (the actual number of colors is returned in a different field).
	Default 256.  Ignored when the application supplies its own color map.

boolean two_pass_quantize
	If TRUE, an extra pass over the image is made to select a custom color
	map for the image.  This usually looks a lot better than the one-size-
	fits-all colormap that is used otherwise.  Default is TRUE.  Ignored
	when the application supplies its own color map.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L259">J_DITHER_MODE</a> dither_mode
	Selects color dithering method.  Supported values are:
		JDITHER_NONE	no dithering: fast, very low quality
		JDITHER_ORDERED	ordered dither: moderate speed and quality
		JDITHER_FS	Floyd-Steinberg dither: slow, high quality
	Default is JDITHER_FS.  (At present, ordered dither is implemented
	only in the single-pass, standard-colormap case.  If you ask for
	ordered dither when two_pass_quantize is TRUE or when you supply
	an external color map, you'll get F-S dithering.)

When quantize_colors is TRUE, the target color map is described by the next
two fields.  colormap is set to NULL by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>().  The application
can supply a color map by setting colormap non-NULL and setting
actual_number_of_colors to the map size.  Otherwise, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>()
selects a suitable color map and sets these two fields itself.
[Implementation restriction: at present, an externally supplied colormap is
only accepted for 3-component output color spaces.]

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L76">JSAMPARRAY</a> colormap
	The color map, represented as a 2-D pixel array of out_color_components
	rows and actual_number_of_colors columns.  Ignored if not quantizing.
	CAUTION: if the JPEG library creates its own colormap, the storage
	pointed to by this field is released by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>().
	Copy the colormap somewhere else first, if you want to save it.

int actual_number_of_colors
	The number of colors in the color map.

Additional decompression parameters that the application may set include:

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L244">J_DCT_METHOD</a> dct_method
	Selects the algorithm used for the DCT step.  Choices are the same
	as described above for compression.

boolean do_fancy_upsampling
	If TRUE, use direct DCT scaling with DCT size &gt; 8 for upsampling
	of chroma components.
	If FALSE, use only DCT size &lt;= 8 and simple separate upsampling.
	Default is TRUE.
	For better image stability in multiple generation compression cycles
	it is preferable that this value matches the corresponding
	do_fancy_downsampling value in compression.

boolean do_block_smoothing
	If TRUE, interblock smoothing is applied in early stages of decoding
	progressive JPEG files; if FALSE, not.  Default is TRUE.  Early
	progression stages look "fuzzy" with smoothing, "blocky" without.
	In any case, block smoothing ceases to be applied after the first few
	AC coefficients are known to full accuracy, so it is relevant only
	when using buffered-image mode for progressive images.

boolean enable_1pass_quant
boolean enable_external_quant
boolean enable_2pass_quant
	These are significant only in buffered-image mode, which is
	described in its own section below.


The output image dimensions are given by the following fields.  These are
computed from the source image dimensions and the decompression parameters
by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().  You can also call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1080">jpeg_calc_output_dimensions</a>()
to obtain the values that will result from the current parameter settings.
This can be useful if you are trying to pick a scaling ratio that will get
close to a desired target size.  It's also important if you are using the
JPEG library's memory manager to allocate output buffer space, because you
are supposed to request such buffers *before* <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().

JDIMENSION output_width		Actual dimensions of output image.
JDIMENSION output_height
int out_color_components	Number of color components in out_color_space.
int output_components		Number of color components returned.
int rec_outbuf_height		Recommended height of scanline buffer.

When quantizing colors, output_components is 1, indicating a single color map
index per pixel.  Otherwise it equals out_color_components.  The output arrays
are required to be output_width * output_components JSAMPLEs wide.

rec_outbuf_height is the recommended minimum height (in scanlines) of the
buffer passed to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>().  If the buffer is smaller, the
library will still work, but time will be wasted due to unnecessary data
copying.  In high-quality modes, rec_outbuf_height is always 1, but some
faster, lower-quality modes set it to larger values (typically 2 to 4).
If you are going to ask for a high-speed processing mode, you may as well
go to the trouble of honoring rec_outbuf_height so as to avoid data copying.
(An output buffer larger than rec_outbuf_height lines is OK, but won't
provide any material speed improvement over that height.)
