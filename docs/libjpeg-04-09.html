<h2>Abbreviated datastreams and multiple images</h2>

<pre>
A JPEG compression or decompression object can be reused to process multiple
images.  This saves a small amount of time per image by eliminating the
"create" and "destroy" operations, but that isn't the real purpose of the
feature.  Rather, reuse of an object provides support for abbreviated JPEG
datastreams.  Object reuse can also simplify processing a series of images in
a single input or output file.  This section explains these features.

A JPEG file normally contains several hundred bytes worth of quantization
and Huffman tables.  In a situation where many images will be stored or
transmitted with identical tables, this may represent an annoying overhead.
The JPEG standard therefore permits tables to be omitted.  The standard
defines three classes of JPEG datastreams:
  * "Interchange" datastreams contain an image and all tables needed to decode
     the image.  These are the usual kind of JPEG file.
  * "Abbreviated image" datastreams contain an image, but are missing some or
    all of the tables needed to decode that image.
  * "Abbreviated table specification" (henceforth "tables-only") datastreams
    contain only table specifications.
To decode an abbreviated image, it is necessary to load the missing table(s)
into the decoder beforehand.  This can be accomplished by reading a separate
tables-only file.  A variant scheme uses a series of images in which the first
image is an interchange (complete) datastream, while subsequent ones are
abbreviated and rely on the tables loaded by the first image.  It is assumed
that once the decoder has read a table, it will remember that table until a
new definition for the same table number is encountered.

It is the application designer's responsibility to figure out how to associate
the correct tables with an abbreviated image.  While abbreviated datastreams
can be useful in a closed environment, their use is strongly discouraged in
any situation where data exchange with other applications might be needed.
Caveat designer.

The JPEG library provides support for reading and writing any combination of
tables-only datastreams and abbreviated images.  In both compression and
decompression objects, a quantization or Huffman table will be retained for
the lifetime of the object, unless it is overwritten by a new table definition.


To create abbreviated image datastreams, it is only necessary to tell the
compressor not to emit some or all of the tables it is using.  Each
quantization and Huffman table struct contains a boolean field "sent_table",
which normally is initialized to FALSE.  For each table used by the image, the
header-writing process emits the table and sets sent_table = TRUE unless it is
already TRUE.  (In normal usage, this prevents outputting the same table
definition multiple times, as would otherwise occur because the chroma
components typically share tables.)  Thus, setting this field to TRUE before
calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() will prevent the table from being written at
all.

If you want to create a "pure" abbreviated image file containing no tables,
just call "<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1004">jpeg_suppress_tables</a>(&amp;cinfo, TRUE)" after constructing all the
tables.  If you want to emit some but not all tables, you'll need to set the
individual sent_table fields directly.

To create an abbreviated image, you must also call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>()
with a second parameter of FALSE, not TRUE.  Otherwise <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>()
will force all the sent_table fields to FALSE.  (This is a safety feature to
prevent abbreviated images from being created accidentally.)

To create a tables-only file, perform the same parameter setup that you
normally would, but instead of calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() and so on, call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1036">jpeg_write_tables</a>(&amp;cinfo).  This will write an abbreviated datastream
containing only SOI, DQT and/or DHT markers, and EOI.  All the quantization
and Huffman tables that are currently defined in the compression object will
be emitted unless their sent_tables flag is already TRUE, and then all the
sent_tables flags will be set TRUE.

A sure-fire way to create matching tables-only and abbreviated image files
is to proceed as follows:

	create JPEG compression object
	set JPEG parameters
	set destination to tables-only file
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1036">jpeg_write_tables</a>(&amp;cinfo);
	set destination to image file
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>(&amp;cinfo, FALSE);
	write data...
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>(&amp;cinfo);

Since the JPEG parameters are not altered between writing the table file and
the abbreviated image file, the same tables are sure to be used.  Of course,
you can repeat the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() ... <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>() sequence
many times to produce many abbreviated image files matching the table file.

You cannot suppress output of the computed Huffman tables when Huffman
optimization is selected.  (If you could, there'd be no way to decode the
image...)  Generally, you don't want to set optimize_coding = TRUE when
you are trying to produce abbreviated files.

In some cases you might want to compress an image using tables which are
not stored in the application, but are defined in an interchange or
tables-only file readable by the application.  This can be done by setting up
a JPEG decompression object to read the specification file, then copying the
tables into your compression object.  See <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1096">jpeg_copy_critical_parameters</a>()
for an example of copying quantization tables.


To read abbreviated image files, you simply need to load the proper tables
into the decompression object before trying to read the abbreviated image.
If the proper tables are stored in the application program, you can just
allocate the table structs and fill in their contents directly.  For example,
to load a fixed quantization table into table slot "n":

    if (cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] == NULL)
      cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1006">jpeg_alloc_quant_table</a>((j_common_ptr) &amp;cinfo);
    quant_ptr = cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n];	/* quant_ptr is JQUANT_TBL* */
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 64; i++) {
      /* Qtable[] is desired quantization table, in natural array order */
      quant_ptr-&gt;quantval[i] = Qtable[i];
    }

Code to load a fixed Huffman table is typically (for AC table "n"):

    if (cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n] == NULL)
      cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n] = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1007">jpeg_alloc_huff_table</a>((j_common_ptr) &amp;cinfo);
    huff_ptr = cinfo.ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[n];	/* huff_ptr is JHUFF_TBL* */
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 16; i++) {
      /* counts[i] is number of Huffman codes of length i bits, i=1..16 */
      huff_ptr-&gt;bits[i] = counts[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {
      /* symbols[] is the list of Huffman symbols, in code-length order */
      huff_ptr-&gt;huffval[i] = symbols[i];
    }

(Note that trying to set cinfo.quant_tbl_ptrs[n] to point directly at a
constant JQUANT_TBL object is not safe.  If the incoming file happened to
contain a quantization table definition, your master table would get
overwritten!  Instead allocate a working table copy and copy the master table
into it, as illustrated above.  Ditto for Huffman tables, of course.)

You might want to read the tables from a tables-only file, rather than
hard-wiring them into your application.  The <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() call is
sufficient to read a tables-only file.  You must pass a second parameter of
FALSE to indicate that you do not require an image to be present.  Thus, the
typical scenario is

	create JPEG decompression object
	set source to tables-only file
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(&amp;cinfo, FALSE);
	set source to abbreviated image file
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(&amp;cinfo, TRUE);
	set decompression parameters
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>(&amp;cinfo);
	read data...
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>(&amp;cinfo);

In some cases, you may want to read a file without knowing whether it contains
an image or just tables.  In that case, pass FALSE and check the return value
from <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(): it will be JPEG_HEADER_OK if an image was found,
JPEG_HEADER_TABLES_ONLY if only tables were found.  (A third return value,
JPEG_SUSPENDED, is possible when using a suspending data source manager.)
Note that <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() will not complain if you read an abbreviated
image for which you haven't loaded the missing tables; the missing-table check
occurs later, in <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().


It is possible to read a series of images from a single source file by
repeating the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() ... <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() sequence,
without releasing/recreating the JPEG object or the data source module.
(If you did reinitialize, any partial bufferload left in the data source
buffer at the end of one image would be discarded, causing you to lose the
start of the next image.)  When you use this method, stored tables are
automatically carried forward, so some of the images can be abbreviated images
that depend on tables from earlier images.

If you intend to write a series of images into a single destination file,
you might want to make a specialized data destination module that doesn't
flush the output buffer at term_destination() time.  This would speed things
up by some trifling amount.  Of course, you'd need to remember to flush the
buffer after the last image.  You can make the later images be abbreviated
ones by passing FALSE to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>().
