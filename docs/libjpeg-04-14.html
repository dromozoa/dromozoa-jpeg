<h2>Memory management</h2>

<pre>
This section covers some key facts about the JPEG library's built-in memory
manager.  For more info, please read structure.txt's section about the memory
manager, and consult the source code if necessary.

All memory and temporary file allocation within the library is done via the
memory manager.  If necessary, you can replace the "back end" of the memory
manager to control allocation yourself (for example, if you don't want the
library to use malloc() and free() for some reason).

Some data is allocated "permanently" and will not be freed until the JPEG
object is destroyed.  Most data is allocated "per image" and is freed by
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>, or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>.  You can call the
memory manager yourself to allocate structures that will automatically be
freed at these times.  Typical code for this is
  ptr = (*cinfo-&gt;mem-&gt;alloc_small) ((<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L284">j_common_ptr</a>) cinfo, JPOOL_IMAGE, size);
Use JPOOL_PERMANENT to get storage that lasts as long as the JPEG object.
Use alloc_large instead of alloc_small for anything bigger than a few Kbytes.
There are also alloc_sarray and alloc_barray routines that automatically
build 2-D sample or block arrays.

The library's minimum space requirements to process an image depend on the
image's width, but not on its height, because the library ordinarily works
with "strip" buffers that are as wide as the image but just a few rows high.
Some operating modes (eg, two-pass color quantization) require full-image
buffers.  Such buffers are treated as "virtual arrays": only the current strip
need be in memory, and the rest can be swapped out to a temporary file.

If you use the simplest memory manager back end (jmemnobs.c), then no
temporary files are used; virtual arrays are simply malloc()'d.  Images bigger
than memory can be processed only if your system supports virtual memory.
The other memory manager back ends support temporary files of various flavors
and thus work in machines without virtual memory.  They may also be useful on
Unix machines if you need to process images that exceed available swap space.

When using temporary files, the library will make the in-memory buffers for
its virtual arrays just big enough to stay within a "maximum memory" setting.
Your application can set this limit by setting cinfo-&gt;mem-&gt;max_memory_to_use
after creating the JPEG object.  (Of course, there is still a minimum size for
the buffers, so the max-memory setting is effective only if it is bigger than
the minimum space needed.)  If you allocate any large structures yourself, you
must allocate them before <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() in
order to have them counted against the max memory limit.  Also keep in mind
that space allocated with alloc_small() is ignored, on the assumption that
it's too small to be worth worrying about; so a reasonable safety margin
should be left when setting max_memory_to_use.

If you use the jmemname.c or jmemdos.c memory manager back end, it is
important to clean up the JPEG object properly to ensure that the temporary
files get deleted.  (This is especially crucial with jmemdos.c, where the
"temporary files" may be extended-memory segments; if they are not freed,
DOS will require a reboot to recover the memory.)  Thus, with these memory
managers, it's a good idea to provide a signal handler that will trap any
early exit from your program.  The handler should call either <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>()
or <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>() for any active JPEG objects.  A handler is not needed with
jmemnobs.c, and shouldn't be necessary with jmemansi.c or jmemmac.c either,
since the C library is supposed to take care of deleting files made with
tmpfile().
