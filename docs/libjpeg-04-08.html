<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Buffered-image mode</h2>

<pre>
In buffered-image mode, the library stores the partially decoded image in a
coefficient buffer, from which it can be read out as many times as desired.
This mode is typically used for incremental display of progressive JPEG files,
but it can be used with any JPEG file.  Each scan of a progressive JPEG file
adds more data (more detail) to the buffered image.  The application can
display in lockstep with the source file (one display pass per input scan),
or it can allow input processing to outrun display processing.  By making
input and display processing run independently, it is possible for the
application to adapt progressive display to a wide range of data transmission
rates.

The basic control flow for buffered-image decoding is

	jpeg_create_decompress()
	set data source
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>()
	set overall decompression parameters
	cinfo.buffered_image = TRUE;	/* select buffered-image mode */
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>()
	for (each output pass) {
	    adjust output decompression parameters if required
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>()		/* start a new output pass */
	    for (all scanlines in image) {
	        <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>()
	        display scanlines
	    }
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>()	/* terminate output pass */
	}
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>()
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L970">jpeg_destroy_decompress</a>()

This differs from ordinary unbuffered decoding in that there is an additional
level of looping.  The application can choose how many output passes to make
and how to display each pass.

The simplest approach to displaying progressive images is to do one display
pass for each scan appearing in the input file.  In this case the outer loop
condition is typically
	while (! <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>(&amp;cinfo))
and the start-output call should read
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(&amp;cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
The second parameter to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() indicates which scan of the input
file is to be displayed; the scans are numbered starting at 1 for this
purpose.  (You can use a loop counter starting at 1 if you like, but using
the library's input scan counter is easier.)  The library automatically reads
data as necessary to complete each requested scan, and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>()
advances to the next scan or end-of-image marker (hence input_scan_number
will be incremented by the time control arrives back at <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>()).
With this technique, data is read from the input file only as needed, and
input and output processing run in lockstep.

After reading the final scan and reaching the end of the input file, the
buffered image remains available; it can be read additional times by
repeating the <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>()/<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>()/<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>()
sequence.  For example, a useful technique is to use fast one-pass color
quantization for display passes made while the image is arriving, followed by
a final display pass using two-pass quantization for highest quality.  This
is done by changing the library parameters before the final output pass.
Changing parameters between passes is discussed in detail below.

In general the last scan of a progressive file cannot be recognized as such
until after it is read, so a post-input display pass is the best approach if
you want special processing in the final pass.

When done with the image, be sure to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() to release
the buffered image (or just use <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L970">jpeg_destroy_decompress</a>()).

If input data arrives faster than it can be displayed, the application can
cause the library to decode input data in advance of what's needed to produce
output.  This is done by calling the routine <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>().
The return value is one of the following:
	JPEG_REACHED_SOS:    reached an SOS marker (the start of a new scan)
	JPEG_REACHED_EOI:    reached the EOI marker (end of image)
	JPEG_ROW_COMPLETED:  completed reading one MCU row of compressed data
	JPEG_SCAN_COMPLETED: completed reading last MCU row of current scan
	JPEG_SUSPENDED:      suspended before completing any of the above
(JPEG_SUSPENDED can occur only if a suspending data source is used.)  This
routine can be called at any time after initializing the JPEG object.  It
reads some additional data and returns when one of the indicated significant
events occurs.  (If called after the EOI marker is reached, it will
immediately return JPEG_REACHED_EOI without attempting to read more data.)

The library's output processing will automatically call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>()
whenever the output processing overtakes the input; thus, simple lockstep
display requires no direct calls to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>().  But by adding
calls to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>(), you can absorb data in advance of what is
being displayed.  This has two benefits:
  * You can limit buildup of unprocessed data in your input buffer.
  * You can eliminate extra display passes by paying attention to the
    state of the library's input processing.

The first of these benefits only requires interspersing calls to
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() with your display operations and any other processing
you may be doing.  To avoid wasting cycles due to backtracking, it's best to
call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() only after a hundred or so new bytes have arrived.
This is discussed further under "I/O suspension", above.  (Note: the JPEG
library currently is not thread-safe.  You must not call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>()
from one thread of control if a different library routine is working on the
same JPEG object in another thread.)

When input arrives fast enough that more than one new scan is available
before you start a new output pass, you may as well skip the output pass
corresponding to the completed scan.  This occurs for free if you pass
cinfo.input_scan_number as the target scan number to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>().
The input_scan_number field is simply the index of the scan currently being
consumed by the input processor.  You can ensure that this is up-to-date by
emptying the input buffer just before calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(): call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() repeatedly until it returns JPEG_SUSPENDED or
JPEG_REACHED_EOI.

The target scan number passed to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() is saved in the
cinfo.output_scan_number field.  The library's output processing calls
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() whenever the current input scan number and row within
that scan is less than or equal to the current output scan number and row.
Thus, input processing can "get ahead" of the output processing but is not
allowed to "fall behind".  You can achieve several different effects by
manipulating this interlock rule.  For example, if you pass a target scan
number greater than the current input scan number, the output processor will
wait until that scan starts to arrive before producing any output.  (To avoid
an infinite loop, the target scan number is automatically reset to the last
scan number when the end of image is reached.  Thus, if you specify a large
target scan number, the library will just absorb the entire input file and
then perform an output pass.  This is effectively the same as what
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() does when you don't select buffered-image mode.)
When you pass a target scan number equal to the current input scan number,
the image is displayed no faster than the current input scan arrives.  The
final possibility is to pass a target scan number less than the current input
scan number; this disables the input/output interlock and causes the output
processor to simply display whatever it finds in the image buffer, without
waiting for input.  (However, the library will not accept a target scan
number less than one, so you can't avoid waiting for the first scan.)

When data is arriving faster than the output display processing can advance
through the image, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() will store data into the buffered
image beyond the point at which the output processing is reading data out
again.  If the input arrives fast enough, it may "wrap around" the buffer to
the point where the input is more than one whole scan ahead of the output.
If the output processing simply proceeds through its display pass without
paying attention to the input, the effect seen on-screen is that the lower
part of the image is one or more scans better in quality than the upper part.
Then, when the next output scan is started, you have a choice of what target
scan number to use.  The recommended choice is to use the current input scan
number at that time, which implies that you've skipped the output scans
corresponding to the input scans that were completed while you processed the
previous output scan.  In this way, the decoder automatically adapts its
speed to the arriving data, by skipping output scans as necessary to keep up
with the arriving data.

When using this strategy, you'll want to be sure that you perform a final
output pass after receiving all the data; otherwise your last display may not
be full quality across the whole screen.  So the right outer loop logic is
something like this:
	do {
	    absorb any waiting input by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>()
	    final_pass = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>(&amp;cinfo);
	    adjust output decompression parameters if required
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(&amp;cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
	    ...
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>()
	} while (! final_pass);
rather than quitting as soon as <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>() returns TRUE.  This
arrangement makes it simple to use higher-quality decoding parameters
for the final pass.  But if you don't want to use special parameters for
the final pass, the right loop logic is like this:
	for (;;) {
	    absorb any waiting input by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>()
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(&amp;cinfo, cinfo.input_scan_number);
	    ...
	    <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>()
	    if (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>(&amp;cinfo) &amp;&amp;
	        cinfo.input_scan_number == cinfo.output_scan_number)
	      break;
	}
In this case you don't need to know in advance whether an output pass is to
be the last one, so it's not necessary to have reached EOF before starting
the final output pass; rather, what you want to test is whether the output
pass was performed in sync with the final input scan.  This form of the loop
will avoid an extra output pass whenever the decoder is able (or nearly able)
to keep up with the incoming data.

When the data transmission speed is high, you might begin a display pass,
then find that much or all of the file has arrived before you can complete
the pass.  (You can detect this by noting the JPEG_REACHED_EOI return code
from <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>(), or equivalently by testing <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>().)
In this situation you may wish to abort the current display pass and start a
new one using the newly arrived information.  To do so, just call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>() and then start a new pass with <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>().

A variant strategy is to abort and restart display if more than one complete
scan arrives during an output pass; this can be detected by noting
JPEG_REACHED_SOS returns and/or examining cinfo.input_scan_number.  This
idea should be employed with caution, however, since the display process
might never get to the bottom of the image before being aborted, resulting
in the lower part of the screen being several passes worse than the upper.
In most cases it's probably best to abort an output pass only if the whole
file has arrived and you want to begin the final output pass immediately.

When receiving data across a communication link, we recommend always using
the current input scan number for the output target scan number; if a
higher-quality final pass is to be done, it should be started (aborting any
incomplete output pass) as soon as the end of file is received.  However,
many other strategies are possible.  For example, the application can examine
the parameters of the current input scan and decide whether to display it or
not.  If the scan contains only chroma data, one might choose not to use it
as the target scan, expecting that the scan will be small and will arrive
quickly.  To skip to the next scan, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() until it
returns JPEG_REACHED_SOS or JPEG_REACHED_EOI.  Or just use the next higher
number as the target scan for <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(); but that method doesn't
let you inspect the next scan's parameters before deciding to display it.


In buffered-image mode, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() never performs input and
thus never suspends.  An application that uses input suspension with
buffered-image mode must be prepared for suspension returns from these
routines:
* <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() performs input only if you request 2-pass quantization
  and the target scan isn't fully read yet.  (This is discussed below.)
* <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>(), as always, returns the number of scanlines that it
  was able to produce before suspending.
* <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>() will read any markers following the target scan,
  up to the end of the file or the SOS marker that begins another scan.
  (But it reads no input if <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() has already reached the
  end of the file or a SOS marker beyond the target output scan.)
* <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>() will read until the end of file, and thus can
  suspend if the end hasn't already been reached (as can be tested by
  calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1068">jpeg_input_complete</a>()).
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(), <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>(), and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>()
all return TRUE if they completed their tasks, FALSE if they had to suspend.
In the event of a FALSE return, the application must load more input data
and repeat the call.  Applications that use non-suspending data sources need
not check the return values of these three routines.


It is possible to change decoding parameters between output passes in the
buffered-image mode.  The decoder library currently supports only very
limited changes of parameters.  ONLY THE FOLLOWING parameter changes are
allowed after <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() is called:
* dct_method can be changed before each call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>().
  For example, one could use a fast DCT method for early scans, changing
  to a higher quality method for the final scan.
* dither_mode can be changed before each call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>();
  of course this has no impact if not using color quantization.  Typically
  one would use ordered dither for initial passes, then switch to
  Floyd-Steinberg dither for the final pass.  Caution: changing dither mode
  can cause more memory to be allocated by the library.  Although the amount
  of memory involved is not large (a scanline or so), it may cause the
  initial max_memory_to_use specification to be exceeded, which in the worst
  case would result in an out-of-memory failure.
* do_block_smoothing can be changed before each call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>().
  This setting is relevant only when decoding a progressive JPEG image.
  During the first DC-only scan, block smoothing provides a very "fuzzy" look
  instead of the very "blocky" look seen without it; which is better seems a
  matter of personal taste.  But block smoothing is nearly always a win
  during later stages, especially when decoding a successive-approximation
  image: smoothing helps to hide the slight blockiness that otherwise shows
  up on smooth gradients until the lowest coefficient bits are sent.
* Color quantization mode can be changed under the rules described below.
  You *cannot* change between full-color and quantized output (because that
  would alter the required I/O buffer sizes), but you can change which
  quantization method is used.

When generating color-quantized output, changing quantization method is a
very useful way of switching between high-speed and high-quality display.
The library allows you to change among its three quantization methods:
1. Single-pass quantization to a fixed color cube.
   Selected by cinfo.two_pass_quantize = FALSE and cinfo.colormap = NULL.
2. Single-pass quantization to an application-supplied colormap.
   Selected by setting cinfo.colormap to point to the colormap (the value of
   two_pass_quantize is ignored); also set cinfo.actual_number_of_colors.
3. Two-pass quantization to a colormap chosen specifically for the image.
   Selected by cinfo.two_pass_quantize = TRUE and cinfo.colormap = NULL.
   (This is the default setting selected by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>, but it is
   probably NOT what you want for the first pass of progressive display!)
These methods offer successively better quality and lesser speed.  However,
only the first method is available for quantizing in non-RGB color spaces.

IMPORTANT: because the different quantizer methods have very different
working-storage requirements, the library requires you to indicate which
one(s) you intend to use before you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().  (If we did
not require this, the max_memory_to_use setting would be a complete fiction.)
You do this by setting one or more of these three cinfo fields to TRUE:
	enable_1pass_quant		Fixed color cube colormap
	enable_external_quant		Externally-supplied colormap
	enable_2pass_quant		Two-pass custom colormap
All three are initialized FALSE by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>().  But
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() automatically sets TRUE the one selected by the
current two_pass_quantize and colormap settings, so you only need to set the
enable flags for any other quantization methods you plan to change to later.

After setting the enable flags correctly at <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() time, you
can change to any enabled quantization method by setting two_pass_quantize
and colormap properly just before calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>().  The following
special rules apply:
1. You must explicitly set cinfo.colormap to NULL when switching to 1-pass
   or 2-pass mode from a different mode, or when you want the 2-pass
   quantizer to be re-run to generate a new colormap.
2. To switch to an external colormap, or to change to a different external
   colormap than was used on the prior pass, you must call
   <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1069">jpeg_new_colormap</a>() after setting cinfo.colormap.
NOTE: if you want to use the same colormap as was used in the prior pass,
you should not do either of these things.  This will save some nontrivial
switchover costs.
(These requirements exist because cinfo.colormap will always be non-NULL
after completing a prior output pass, since both the 1-pass and 2-pass
quantizers set it to point to their output colormaps.  Thus you have to
do one of these two things to notify the library that something has changed.
Yup, it's a bit klugy, but it's necessary to do it this way for backwards
compatibility.)

Note that in buffered-image mode, the library generates any requested colormap
during <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>(), not during <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>().

When using two-pass quantization, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() makes a pass over the
buffered image to determine the optimum color map; it therefore may take a
significant amount of time, whereas ordinarily it does little work.  The
progress monitor hook is called during this pass, if defined.  It is also
important to realize that if the specified target scan number is greater than
or equal to the current input scan number, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() will attempt
to consume input as it makes this pass.  If you use a suspending data source,
you need to check for a FALSE return from <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() under these
conditions.  The combination of 2-pass quantization and a not-yet-fully-read
target scan is the only case in which <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1065">jpeg_start_output</a>() will consume input.


Application authors who support buffered-image mode may be tempted to use it
for all JPEG images, even single-scan ones.  This will work, but it is
inefficient: there is no need to create an image-sized coefficient buffer for
single-scan images.  Requesting buffered-image mode for such an image wastes
memory.  Worse, it can cost time on large images, since the buffered data has
to be swapped out or written to a temporary file.  If you are concerned about
maximum performance on baseline JPEG files, you should use buffered-image
mode only when the incoming file actually has multiple scans.  This can be
tested by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1064">jpeg_has_multiple_scans</a>(), which will return a correct
result at any time after <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() completes.

It is also worth noting that when you use <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() to let input
processing get ahead of output processing, the resulting pattern of access to
the coefficient buffer is quite nonsequential.  It's best to use the memory
manager jmemnobs.c if you can (ie, if you have enough real or virtual main
memory).  If not, at least make sure that max_memory_to_use is set as high as
possible.  If the JPEG memory manager has to use a temporary file, you will
probably see a lot of disk traffic and poor performance.  (This could be
improved with additional work on the memory manager, but we haven't gotten
around to it yet.)

In some applications it may be convenient to use <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() for all
input processing, including reading the initial markers; that is, you may
wish to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() instead of <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() during
startup.  This works, but note that you must check for JPEG_REACHED_SOS and
JPEG_REACHED_EOI return codes as the equivalent of <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>'s codes.
Once the first SOS marker has been reached, you must call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>() before <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() will consume more input;
it'll just keep returning JPEG_REACHED_SOS until you do.  If you read a
tables-only file this way, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() will return JPEG_REACHED_EOI
without ever returning JPEG_REACHED_SOS; be sure to check for this case.
If this happens, the decompressor will not read any more input until you call
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>() to reset it.  It is OK to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1070">jpeg_consume_input</a>() even when not
using buffered-image mode, but in that case it's basically a no-op after the
initial markers have been read: it will just return JPEG_SUSPENDED.
