<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Compression parameter selection</h2>

<pre>
This section describes all the optional parameters you can set for JPEG
compression, as well as the "helper" routines provided to assist in this
task.  Proper setting of some parameters requires detailed understanding
of the JPEG standard; if you don't know what a parameter is for, it's best
not to mess with it!  See REFERENCES in the README file for pointers to
more info about JPEG.

It's a good idea to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() first, even if you plan to set
all the parameters; that way your code is more likely to work with future JPEG
libraries that have additional parameters.  For the same reason, we recommend
you use a helper routine where one is provided, in preference to twiddling
cinfo fields directly.

The helper routines are:

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	This routine sets all JPEG parameters to reasonable defaults, using
	only the input image's color space (field in_color_space, which must
	already be set in cinfo).  Many applications will only need to use
	this routine and perhaps <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L991">jpeg_set_quality</a>().

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L229">J_COLOR_SPACE</a> colorspace)
	Sets the JPEG file's colorspace (field jpeg_color_space) as specified,
	and sets other color-space-dependent parameters appropriately.  See
	"Special color spaces", below, before using this.  A large number of
	parameters, including all per-component parameters, are set by this
	routine; if you want to twiddle individual parameters you should call
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() before rather than after.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L990">jpeg_default_colorspace</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Selects an appropriate JPEG colorspace based on cinfo-&gt;in_color_space,
	and calls <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>().  This is actually a subroutine of
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>().  It's broken out in case you want to change
	just the colorspace-dependent JPEG parameters.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L991">jpeg_set_quality</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo, int quality, boolean force_baseline)
	Constructs JPEG quantization tables appropriate for the indicated
	quality setting.  The quality value is expressed on the 0..100 scale
	recommended by IJG (cjpeg's "-quality" switch uses this routine).
	Note that the exact mapping from quality values to tables may change
	in future IJG releases as more is learned about DCT quantization.
	If the force_baseline parameter is TRUE, then the quantization table
	entries are constrained to the range 1..255 for full JPEG baseline
	compatibility.  In the current implementation, this only makes a
	difference for quality settings below 25, and it effectively prevents
	very small/low quality files from being generated.  The IJG decoder
	is capable of reading the non-baseline files generated at low quality
	settings when force_baseline is FALSE, but other decoders may not be.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L993">jpeg_set_linear_quality</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo, int scale_factor,
			 boolean force_baseline)
	Same as <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L991">jpeg_set_quality</a>() except that the generated tables are the
	sample tables given in the JPEC spec section K.1, multiplied by the
	specified scale factor (which is expressed as a percentage; thus
	scale_factor = 100 reproduces the spec's tables).  Note that larger
	scale factors give lower quality.  This entry point is useful for
	conforming to the Adobe PostScript DCT conventions, but we do not
	recommend linear scaling as a user-visible quality scale otherwise.
	force_baseline again constrains the computed table entries to 1..255.

int <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1002">jpeg_quality_scaling</a> (int quality)
	Converts a value on the IJG-recommended quality scale to a linear
	scaling percentage.  Note that this routine may change or go away
	in future releases --- IJG may choose to adopt a scaling method that
	can't be expressed as a simple scalar multiplier, in which case the
	premise of this routine collapses.  Caveat user.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L996">jpeg_default_qtables</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo, boolean force_baseline)
	Set default quantization tables with linear q_scale_factor[] values
	(see below).

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L998">jpeg_add_quant_table</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo, int which_tbl,
		      const unsigned int *basic_table,
		      int scale_factor, boolean force_baseline)
	Allows an arbitrary quantization table to be created.  which_tbl
	indicates which table slot to fill.  basic_table points to an array
	of 64 unsigned ints given in normal array order.  These values are
	multiplied by scale_factor/100 and then clamped to the range 1..65535
	(or to 1..255 if force_baseline is TRUE).
	CAUTION: prior to library version 6a, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L998">jpeg_add_quant_table</a> expected
	the basic table to be given in JPEG zigzag order.  If you need to
	write code that works with either older or newer versions of this
	routine, you must check the library version number.  Something like
	"#if JPEG_LIB_VERSION &gt;= 61" is the right test.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1003">jpeg_simple_progression</a> (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L285">j_compress_ptr</a> cinfo)
	Generates a default scan script for writing a progressive-JPEG file.
	This is the recommended method of creating a progressive file,
	unless you want to make a custom scan sequence.  You must ensure that
	the JPEG color space is set correctly before calling this routine.


Compression parameters (cinfo fields) include:

boolean arith_code
	If TRUE, use arithmetic coding.
	If FALSE, use Huffman coding.

int block_size
	Set DCT block size.  All N from 1 to 16 are possible.
	Default is 8 (baseline format).
	Larger values produce higher compression,
	smaller values produce higher quality.
	An exact DCT stage is possible with 1 or 2.
	With the default quality of 75 and default Luminance qtable
	the DCT+Quantization stage is lossless for value 1.
	Note that values other than 8 require a SmartScale capable decoder,
	introduced with IJG JPEG 8.  Setting the block_size parameter for
	compression works with version 8c and later.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L244">J_DCT_METHOD</a> dct_method
	Selects the algorithm used for the DCT step.  Choices are:
		JDCT_ISLOW: slow but accurate integer algorithm
		JDCT_IFAST: faster, less accurate integer method
		JDCT_FLOAT: floating-point method
		JDCT_DEFAULT: default method (normally JDCT_ISLOW)
		JDCT_FASTEST: fastest method (normally JDCT_IFAST)
	The FLOAT method is very slightly more accurate than the ISLOW method,
	but may give different results on different machines due to varying
	roundoff behavior.  The integer methods should give the same results
	on all machines.  On machines with sufficiently fast FP hardware, the
	floating-point method may also be the fastest.  The IFAST method is
	considerably less accurate than the other two; its use is not
	recommended if high quality is a concern.  JDCT_DEFAULT and
	JDCT_FASTEST are macros configurable by each installation.

unsigned int scale_num, scale_denom
	Scale the image by the fraction scale_num/scale_denom.  Default is
	1/1, or no scaling.  Currently, the supported scaling ratios are
	M/N with all N from 1 to 16, where M is the destination DCT size,
	which is 8 by default (see block_size parameter above).
	(The library design allows for arbitrary scaling ratios but this
	is not likely to be implemented any time soon.)

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L229">J_COLOR_SPACE</a> jpeg_color_space
int num_components
	The JPEG color space and corresponding number of components; see
	"Special color spaces", below, for more info.  We recommend using
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() if you want to change these.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L236">J_COLOR_TRANSFORM</a> color_transform
	Internal color transform identifier, writes LSE marker if nonzero
	(requires decoder with inverse color transform support, introduced
	with IJG JPEG 9).
	Two values are currently possible: JCT_NONE and JCT_SUBTRACT_GREEN.
	Set this value for lossless RGB application *before* calling
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>(), because entropy table assignment in
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() depends on color_transform.

boolean optimize_coding
	TRUE causes the compressor to compute optimal Huffman coding tables
	for the image.  This requires an extra pass over the data and
	therefore costs a good deal of space and time.  The default is
	FALSE, which tells the compressor to use the supplied or default
	Huffman tables.  In most cases optimal tables save only a few percent
	of file size compared to the default tables.  Note that when this is
	TRUE, you need not supply Huffman tables at all, and any you do
	supply will be overwritten.

unsigned int restart_interval
int restart_in_rows
	To emit restart markers in the JPEG file, set one of these nonzero.
	Set restart_interval to specify the exact interval in MCU blocks.
	Set restart_in_rows to specify the interval in MCU rows.  (If
	restart_in_rows is not 0, then restart_interval is set after the
	image width in MCUs is computed.)  Defaults are zero (no restarts).
	One restart marker per MCU row is often a good choice.
	NOTE: the overhead of restart markers is higher in grayscale JPEG
	files than in color files, and MUCH higher in progressive JPEGs.
	If you use restarts, you may want to use larger intervals in those
	cases.

const <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L203">jpeg_scan_info</a> * scan_info
int num_scans
	By default, scan_info is NULL; this causes the compressor to write a
	single-scan sequential JPEG file.  If not NULL, scan_info points to
	an array of scan definition records of length num_scans.  The
	compressor will then write a JPEG file having one scan for each scan
	definition record.  This is used to generate noninterleaved or
	progressive JPEG files.  The library checks that the scan array
	defines a valid JPEG scan sequence.  (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1003">jpeg_simple_progression</a> creates
	a suitable scan definition array for progressive JPEG.)  This is
	discussed further under "Progressive JPEG support".

boolean do_fancy_downsampling
	If TRUE, use direct DCT scaling with DCT size &gt; 8 for downsampling
	of chroma components.
	If FALSE, use only DCT size &lt;= 8 and simple separate downsampling.
	Default is TRUE.
	For better image stability in multiple generation compression cycles
	it is preferable that this value matches the corresponding
	do_fancy_upsampling value in decompression.

int smoothing_factor
	If non-zero, the input image is smoothed; the value should be 1 for
	minimal smoothing to 100 for maximum smoothing.  Consult jcsample.c
	for details of the smoothing algorithm.  The default is zero.

boolean write_JFIF_header
	If TRUE, a JFIF APP0 marker is emitted.  <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() and
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() set this TRUE if a JFIF-legal JPEG color space
	(ie, YCbCr or grayscale) is selected, otherwise FALSE.

UINT8 JFIF_major_version
UINT8 JFIF_minor_version
	The version number to be written into the JFIF marker.
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() initializes the version to 1.01 (major=minor=1).
	You should set it to 1.02 (major=1, minor=2) if you plan to write
	any JFIF 1.02 extension markers.

UINT8 density_unit
UINT16 X_density
UINT16 Y_density
	The resolution information to be written into the JFIF marker;
	not used otherwise.  density_unit may be 0 for unknown,
	1 for dots/inch, or 2 for dots/cm.  The default values are 0,1,1
	indicating square pixels of unknown size.

boolean write_Adobe_marker
	If TRUE, an Adobe APP14 marker is emitted.  <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() and
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() set this TRUE if JPEG color space RGB, CMYK,
	or YCCK is selected, otherwise FALSE.  It is generally a bad idea
	to set both write_JFIF_header and write_Adobe_marker.  In fact,
	you probably shouldn't change the default settings at all --- the
	default behavior ensures that the JPEG file's color space can be
	recognized by the decoder.

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L104">JQUANT_TBL</a> * quant_tbl_ptrs[NUM_QUANT_TBLS]
	Pointers to coefficient quantization tables, one per table slot,
	or NULL if no table is defined for a slot.  Usually these should
	be set via one of the above helper routines; <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L998">jpeg_add_quant_table</a>()
	is general enough to define any quantization table.  The other
	routines will set up table slot 0 for luminance quality and table
	slot 1 for chrominance.

int q_scale_factor[NUM_QUANT_TBLS]
	Linear quantization scaling factors (percentage, initialized 100)
	for use with <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L996">jpeg_default_qtables</a>().
	See rdswitch.c and cjpeg.c for an example of usage.
	Note that the q_scale_factor[] fields are the "linear" scales, so you
	have to convert from user-defined ratings via <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1002">jpeg_quality_scaling</a>().
	Here is an example code which corresponds to cjpeg -quality 90,70:

		<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>(cinfo);

		/* Set luminance quality 90. */
		cinfo-&gt;q_scale_factor[0] = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1002">jpeg_quality_scaling</a>(90);
		/* Set chrominance quality 70. */
		cinfo-&gt;q_scale_factor[1] = <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1002">jpeg_quality_scaling</a>(70);

		<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L996">jpeg_default_qtables</a>(cinfo, force_baseline);

	CAUTION: You must also set 1x1 subsampling for efficient separate
	color quality selection, since the default value used by library
	is 2x2:

		cinfo-&gt;comp_info[0].v_samp_factor = 1;
		cinfo-&gt;comp_info[0].h_samp_factor = 1;

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L120">JHUFF_TBL</a> * dc_huff_tbl_ptrs[NUM_HUFF_TBLS]
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L120">JHUFF_TBL</a> * ac_huff_tbl_ptrs[NUM_HUFF_TBLS]
	Pointers to Huffman coding tables, one per table slot, or NULL if
	no table is defined for a slot.  Slots 0 and 1 are filled with the
	JPEG sample tables by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>().  If you need to allocate
	more table structures, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1007">jpeg_alloc_huff_table</a>() may be used.
	Note that optimal Huffman tables can be computed for an image
	by setting optimize_coding, as discussed above; there's seldom
	any need to mess with providing your own Huffman tables.


The actual dimensions of the JPEG image that will be written to the file are
given by the following fields.  These are computed from the input image
dimensions and the compression parameters by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>().  You can
also call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1018">jpeg_calc_jpeg_dimensions</a>() to obtain the values that will result
from the current parameter settings.  This can be useful if you are trying
to pick a scaling ratio that will get close to a desired target size.

JDIMENSION jpeg_width		Actual dimensions of output image.
JDIMENSION jpeg_height


Per-component parameters are stored in the struct cinfo.comp_info[i] for
component number i.  Note that components here refer to components of the
JPEG color space, *not* the source image color space.  A suitably large
comp_info[] array is allocated by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>(); if you choose not
to use that routine, it's up to you to allocate the array.

int component_id
	The one-byte identifier code to be recorded in the JPEG file for
	this component.  For the standard color spaces, we recommend you
	leave the default values alone.

int h_samp_factor
int v_samp_factor
	Horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the component; must
	be 1..4 according to the JPEG standard.  Note that larger sampling
	factors indicate a higher-resolution component; many people find
	this behavior quite unintuitive.  The default values are 2,2 for
	luminance components and 1,1 for chrominance components, except
	for grayscale where 1,1 is used.

int quant_tbl_no
	Quantization table number for component.  The default value is
	0 for luminance components and 1 for chrominance components.

int dc_tbl_no
int ac_tbl_no
	DC and AC entropy coding table numbers.  The default values are
	0 for luminance components and 1 for chrominance components.

int component_index
	Must equal the component's index in comp_info[].  (Beginning in
	release v6, the compressor library will fill this in automatically;
	you don't have to.)
