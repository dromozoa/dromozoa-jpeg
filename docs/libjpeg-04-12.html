<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Really raw data: DCT coefficients</h2>

<pre>
It is possible to read or write the contents of a JPEG file as raw DCT
coefficients.  This facility is mainly intended for use in lossless
transcoding between different JPEG file formats.  Other possible applications
include lossless cropping of a JPEG image, lossless reassembly of a
multi-strip or multi-tile TIFF/JPEG file into a single JPEG datastream, etc.

To read the contents of a JPEG file as DCT coefficients, open the file and do
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() as usual.  But instead of calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1052">jpeg_start_decompress</a>()
and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1053">jpeg_read_scanlines</a>(), call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1093">jpeg_read_coefficients</a>().  This will read the
entire image into a set of virtual coefficient-block arrays, one array per
component.  The return value is a pointer to an array of virtual-array
descriptors.  Each virtual array can be accessed directly using the JPEG
memory manager's access_virt_barray method (see Memory management, below,
and also read structure.txt's discussion of virtual array handling).  Or,
for simple transcoding to a different JPEG file format, the array list can
just be handed directly to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>().

Each block in the block arrays contains quantized coefficient values in
normal array order (not JPEG zigzag order).  The block arrays contain only
DCT blocks containing real data; any entirely-dummy blocks added to fill out
interleaved MCUs at the right or bottom edges of the image are discarded
during reading and are not stored in the block arrays.  (The size of each
block array can be determined from the width_in_blocks and height_in_blocks
fields of the component's comp_info entry.)  This is also the data format
expected by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>().

When you are done using the virtual arrays, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>()
to release the array storage and return the decompression object to an idle
state; or just call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a>() if you don't need to reuse the object.

If you use a suspending data source, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1093">jpeg_read_coefficients</a>() will return
NULL if it is forced to suspend; a non-NULL return value indicates successful
completion.  You need not test for a NULL return value when using a
non-suspending data source.

It is also possible to call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1093">jpeg_read_coefficients</a>() to obtain access to the
decoder's coefficient arrays during a normal decode cycle in buffered-image
mode.  This frammish might be useful for progressively displaying an incoming
image and then re-encoding it without loss.  To do this, decode in buffered-
image mode as discussed previously, then call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1093">jpeg_read_coefficients</a>() after
the last <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1067">jpeg_finish_output</a>() call.  The arrays will be available for your use
until you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>().


To write the contents of a JPEG file as DCT coefficients, you must provide
the DCT coefficients stored in virtual block arrays.  You can either pass
block arrays read from an input JPEG file by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1093">jpeg_read_coefficients</a>(), or
allocate virtual arrays from the JPEG compression object and fill them
yourself.  In either case, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() is substituted for
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>().  Thus the sequence is
  * Create compression object
  * Set all compression parameters as necessary
  * Request virtual arrays if needed
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>()
  * <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>()
  * Destroy or re-use compression object
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() is passed a pointer to an array of virtual block
array descriptors; the number of arrays is equal to cinfo.num_components.

The virtual arrays need only have been requested, not realized, before
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() is called.  A side-effect of
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() is to realize any virtual arrays that have been
requested from the compression object's memory manager.  Thus, when obtaining
the virtual arrays from the compression object, you should fill the arrays
after calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>().  The data is actually written out
when you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>(); <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() only writes
the file header.

When writing raw DCT coefficients, it is crucial that the JPEG quantization
tables and sampling factors match the way the data was encoded, or the
resulting file will be invalid.  For transcoding from an existing JPEG file,
we recommend using <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1096">jpeg_copy_critical_parameters</a>().  This routine initializes
all the compression parameters to default values (like <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>()),
then copies the critical information from a source decompression object.
The decompression object should have just been used to read the entire
JPEG input file --- that is, it should be awaiting <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a>().

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() marks all tables stored in the compression object
as needing to be written to the output file (thus, it acts like
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>(cinfo, TRUE)).  This is for safety's sake, to avoid
emitting abbreviated JPEG files by accident.  If you really want to emit an
abbreviated JPEG file, call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1004">jpeg_suppress_tables</a>(), or set the tables'
individual sent_table flags, between calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1094">jpeg_write_coefficients</a>() and
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1015">jpeg_finish_compress</a>().
