<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Special color spaces</h2>

<pre>
The JPEG standard itself is "color blind" and doesn't specify any particular
color space.  It is customary to convert color data to a luminance/chrominance
color space before compressing, since this permits greater compression.  The
existing JPEG file interchange format standards specify YCbCr or GRAYSCALE
data (JFIF version 1), GRAYSCALE, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK, or YCCK (Adobe), or BG_RGB
or BG_YCC (big gamut color spaces, JFIF version 2).  For special applications
such as multispectral images, other color spaces can be used,
but it must be understood that such files will be unportable.

The JPEG library can handle the most common colorspace conversions (namely
RGB &lt;=&gt; YCbCr and CMYK &lt;=&gt; YCCK).  It can also deal with data of an unknown
color space, passing it through without conversion.  If you deal extensively
with an unusual color space, you can easily extend the library to understand
additional color spaces and perform appropriate conversions.

For compression, the source data's color space is specified by field
in_color_space.  This is transformed to the JPEG file's color space given
by jpeg_color_space.  <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L986">jpeg_set_defaults</a>() chooses a reasonable JPEG color
space depending on in_color_space, but you can override this by calling
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>().  Of course you must select a supported transformation.
jccolor.c currently supports the following transformations:
	RGB =&gt; YCbCr
	RGB =&gt; GRAYSCALE
	RGB =&gt; BG_YCC
	YCbCr =&gt; GRAYSCALE
	YCbCr =&gt; BG_YCC
	CMYK =&gt; YCCK
plus the null transforms: GRAYSCALE =&gt; GRAYSCALE, RGB =&gt; RGB,
BG_RGB =&gt; BG_RGB, YCbCr =&gt; YCbCr, BG_YCC =&gt; BG_YCC, CMYK =&gt; CMYK,
YCCK =&gt; YCCK, and UNKNOWN =&gt; UNKNOWN.

The file interchange format standards (JFIF and Adobe) specify APPn markers
that indicate the color space of the JPEG file.  It is important to ensure
that these are written correctly, or omitted if the JPEG file's color space
is not one of the ones supported by the interchange standards.
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>() will set the compression parameters to include or omit
the APPn markers properly, so long as it is told the truth about the JPEG
color space.  For example, if you are writing some random 3-component color
space without conversion, don't try to fake out the library by setting
in_color_space and jpeg_color_space to JCS_YCbCr; use JCS_UNKNOWN.
You may want to write an APPn marker of your own devising to identify
the colorspace --- see "Special markers", below.

When told that the color space is UNKNOWN, the library will default to using
luminance-quality compression parameters for all color components.  You may
well want to change these parameters.  See the source code for
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L988">jpeg_set_colorspace</a>(), in jcparam.c, for details.

For decompression, the JPEG file's color space is given in jpeg_color_space,
and this is transformed to the output color space out_color_space.
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>'s setting of jpeg_color_space can be relied on if the file
conforms to JFIF or Adobe conventions, but otherwise it is no better than a
guess.  If you know the JPEG file's color space for certain, you can override
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>'s guess by setting jpeg_color_space.  <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a> also
selects a default output color space based on (its guess of) jpeg_color_space;
set out_color_space to override this.  Again, you must select a supported
transformation.  jdcolor.c currently supports
	YCbCr =&gt; RGB
	YCbCr =&gt; GRAYSCALE
	BG_YCC =&gt; RGB
	BG_YCC =&gt; GRAYSCALE
	RGB =&gt; GRAYSCALE
	GRAYSCALE =&gt; RGB
	YCCK =&gt; CMYK
as well as the null transforms.  (Since GRAYSCALE=&gt;RGB is provided, an
application can force grayscale JPEGs to look like color JPEGs if it only
wants to handle one case.)

The two-pass color quantizer, jquant2.c, is specialized to handle RGB data
(it weights distances appropriately for RGB colors).  You'll need to modify
the code if you want to use it for non-RGB output color spaces.  Note that
jquant2.c is used to map to an application-supplied colormap as well as for
the normal two-pass colormap selection process.

CAUTION: it appears that Adobe Photoshop writes inverted data in CMYK JPEG
files: 0 represents 100% ink coverage, rather than 0% ink as you'd expect.
This is arguably a bug in Photoshop, but if you need to work with Photoshop
CMYK files, you will have to deal with it in your application.  We cannot
"fix" this in the library by inverting the data during the CMYK&lt;=&gt;YCCK
transform, because that would break other applications, notably Ghostscript.
Photoshop versions prior to 3.0 write EPS files containing JPEG-encoded CMYK
data in the same inverted-YCCK representation used in bare JPEG files, but
the surrounding PostScript code performs an inversion using the PS image
operator.  I am told that Photoshop 3.0 will write uninverted YCCK in
EPS/JPEG files, and will omit the PS-level inversion.  (But the data
polarity used in bare JPEG files will not change in 3.0.)  In either case,
the JPEG library must not invert the data itself, or else Ghostscript would
read these EPS files incorrectly.
