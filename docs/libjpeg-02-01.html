<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>

<h2>Functions provided by the library</h2>

<pre>
The IJG JPEG library provides C code to read and write JPEG-compressed image
files.  The surrounding application program receives or supplies image data a
scanline at a time, using a straightforward uncompressed image format.  All
details of color conversion and other preprocessing/postprocessing can be
handled by the library.

The library includes a substantial amount of code that is not covered by the
JPEG standard but is necessary for typical applications of JPEG.  These
functions preprocess the image before JPEG compression or postprocess it after
decompression.  They include colorspace conversion, downsampling/upsampling,
and color quantization.  The application indirectly selects use of this code
by specifying the format in which it wishes to supply or receive image data.
For example, if colormapped output is requested, then the decompression
library automatically invokes color quantization.

A wide range of quality vs. speed tradeoffs are possible in JPEG processing,
and even more so in decompression postprocessing.  The decompression library
provides multiple implementations that cover most of the useful tradeoffs,
ranging from very-high-quality down to fast-preview operation.  On the
compression side we have generally not provided low-quality choices, since
compression is normally less time-critical.  It should be understood that the
low-quality modes may not meet the JPEG standard's accuracy requirements;
nonetheless, they are useful for viewers.

A word about functions *not* provided by the library.  We handle a subset of
the ISO JPEG standard; most baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
JPEG processes are supported.  (Our subset includes all features now in common
use.)  Unsupported ISO options include:
	* Hierarchical storage
	* Lossless JPEG
	* DNL marker
	* Nonintegral subsampling ratios
We support 8-bit to 12-bit data precision, but this is a compile-time choice
rather than a run-time choice; hence it is difficult to use different
precisions in a single application.

By itself, the library handles only interchange JPEG datastreams --- in
particular the widely used JFIF file format.  The library can be used by
surrounding code to process interchange or abbreviated JPEG datastreams that
are embedded in more complex file formats.  (For example, this library is
used by the free LIBTIFF library to support JPEG compression in TIFF.)
