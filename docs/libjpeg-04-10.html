<h1>ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>

<h2>Special markers</h2>

<pre>
Some applications may need to insert or extract special data in the JPEG
datastream.  The JPEG standard provides marker types "COM" (comment) and
"APP0" through "APP15" (application) to hold application-specific data.
Unfortunately, the use of these markers is not specified by the standard.
COM markers are fairly widely used to hold user-supplied text.  The JFIF file
format spec uses APP0 markers with specified initial strings to hold certain
data.  Adobe applications use APP14 markers beginning with the string "Adobe"
for miscellaneous data.  Other APPn markers are rarely seen, but might
contain almost anything.

If you wish to store user-supplied text, we recommend you use COM markers
and place readable 7-bit ASCII text in them.  Newline conventions are not
standardized --- expect to find LF (Unix style), CR/LF (DOS style), or CR
(Mac style).  A robust COM reader should be able to cope with random binary
garbage, including nulls, since some applications generate COM markers
containing non-ASCII junk.  (But yours should not be one of them.)

For program-supplied data, use an APPn marker, and be sure to begin it with an
identifying string so that you can tell whether the marker is actually yours.
It's probably best to avoid using APP0 or APP14 for any private markers.
(NOTE: the upcoming SPIFF standard will use APP8 markers; we recommend you
not use APP8 markers for any private purposes, either.)

Keep in mind that at most 65533 bytes can be put into one marker, but you
can have as many markers as you like.

By default, the IJG compression library will write a JFIF APP0 marker if the
selected JPEG colorspace is grayscale or YCbCr, or an Adobe APP14 marker if
the selected colorspace is RGB, CMYK, or YCCK.  You can disable this, but
we don't recommend it.  The decompression library will recognize JFIF and
Adobe markers and will set the JPEG colorspace properly when one is found.


You can write special markers immediately following the datastream header by
calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1026">jpeg_write_marker</a>() after <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1010">jpeg_start_compress</a>() and before the first
call to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1012">jpeg_write_scanlines</a>().  When you do this, the markers appear after
the SOI and the JFIF APP0 and Adobe APP14 markers (if written), but before
all else.  Specify the marker type parameter as "JPEG_COM" for COM or
"JPEG_APP0 + n" for APPn.  (Actually, <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1026">jpeg_write_marker</a> will let you write
any marker type, but we don't recommend writing any other kinds of marker.)
For example, to write a user comment string pointed to by comment_text:
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1026">jpeg_write_marker</a>(cinfo, JPEG_COM, comment_text, strlen(comment_text));

If it's not convenient to store all the marker data in memory at once,
you can instead call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1030">jpeg_write_m_header</a>() followed by multiple calls to
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1032">jpeg_write_m_byte</a>().  If you do it this way, it's your responsibility to
call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1032">jpeg_write_m_byte</a>() exactly the number of times given in the length
parameter to <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1030">jpeg_write_m_header</a>().  (This method lets you empty the
output buffer partway through a marker, which might be important when
using a suspending data destination module.  In any case, if you are using
a suspending destination, you should flush its buffer after inserting
any special markers.  See "I/O suspension".)

Or, if you prefer to synthesize the marker byte sequence yourself,
you can just cram it straight into the data destination module.

If you are writing JFIF 1.02 extension markers (thumbnail images), don't
forget to set cinfo.JFIF_minor_version = 2 so that the encoder will write the
correct JFIF version number in the JFIF header marker.  The library's default
is to write version 1.01, but that's wrong if you insert any 1.02 extension
markers.  (We could probably get away with just defaulting to 1.02, but there
used to be broken decoders that would complain about unknown minor version
numbers.  To reduce compatibility risks it's safest not to write 1.02 unless
you are actually using 1.02 extensions.)


When reading, two methods of handling special markers are available:
1. You can ask the library to save the contents of COM and/or APPn markers
into memory, and then examine them at your leisure afterwards.
2. You can supply your own routine to process COM and/or APPn markers
on-the-fly as they are read.
The first method is simpler to use, especially if you are using a suspending
data source; writing a marker processor that copes with input suspension is
not easy (consider what happens if the marker is longer than your available
input buffer).  However, the second method conserves memory since the marker
data need not be kept around after it's been processed.

For either method, you'd normally set up marker handling after creating a
decompression object and before calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>(), because the
markers of interest will typically be near the head of the file and so will
be scanned by <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>.  Once you've established a marker handling
method, it will be used for the life of that decompression object
(potentially many datastreams), unless you change it.  Marker handling is
determined separately for COM markers and for each APPn marker code.


To save the contents of special markers in memory, call
	<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1083">jpeg_save_markers</a>(cinfo, marker_code, length_limit)
where marker_code is the marker type to save, JPEG_COM or JPEG_APP0+n.
(To arrange to save all the special marker types, you need to call this
routine 17 times, for COM and APP0-APP15.)  If the incoming marker is longer
than length_limit data bytes, only length_limit bytes will be saved; this
parameter allows you to avoid chewing up memory when you only need to see the
first few bytes of a potentially large marker.  If you want to save all the
data, set length_limit to 0xFFFF; that is enough since marker lengths are only
16 bits.  As a special case, setting length_limit to 0 prevents that marker
type from being saved at all.  (That is the default behavior, in fact.)

After <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>() completes, you can examine the special markers by
following the cinfo-&gt;marker_list pointer chain.  All the special markers in
the file appear in this list, in order of their occurrence in the file (but
omitting any markers of types you didn't ask for).  Both the original data
length and the saved data length are recorded for each list entry; the latter
will not exceed length_limit for the particular marker type.  Note that these
lengths exclude the marker length word, whereas the stored representation
within the JPEG file includes it.  (Hence the maximum data length is really
only 65533.)

It is possible that additional special markers appear in the file beyond the
SOS marker at which <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a> stops; if so, the marker list will be
extended during reading of the rest of the file.  This is not expected to be
common, however.  If you are short on memory you may want to reset the length
limit to zero for all marker types after finishing <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1039">jpeg_read_header</a>, to
ensure that the max_memory_to_use setting cannot be exceeded due to addition
of later markers.

The marker list remains stored until you call <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1056">jpeg_finish_decompress</a> or
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1111">jpeg_abort</a>, at which point the memory is freed and the list is set to empty.
(<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1112">jpeg_destroy</a> also releases the storage, of course.)

Note that the library is internally interested in APP0 and APP14 markers;
if you try to set a small nonzero length limit on these types, the library
will silently force the length up to the minimum it wants.  (But you can set
a zero length limit to prevent them from being saved at all.)  Also, in a
16-bit environment, the maximum length limit may be constrained to less than
65533 by malloc() limitations.  It is therefore best not to assume that the
effective length limit is exactly what you set it to be.


If you want to supply your own marker-reading routine, you do it by calling
<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1088">jpeg_set_marker_processor</a>().  A marker processor routine must have the
signature
	boolean jpeg_marker_parser_method (<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L286">j_decompress_ptr</a> cinfo)
Although the marker code is not explicitly passed, the routine can find it
in cinfo-&gt;unread_marker.  At the time of call, the marker proper has been
read from the data source module.  The processor routine is responsible for
reading the marker length word and the remaining parameter bytes, if any.
Return TRUE to indicate success.  (FALSE should be returned only if you are
using a suspending data source and it tells you to suspend.  See the standard
marker processors in jdmarker.c for appropriate coding methods if you need to
use a suspending data source.)

If you override the default APP0 or APP14 processors, it is up to you to
recognize JFIF and Adobe markers if you want colorspace recognition to occur
properly.  We recommend copying and extending the default processors if you
want to do that.  (A better idea is to save these marker types for later
examination by calling <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1083">jpeg_save_markers</a>(); that method doesn't interfere
with the library's own processing of these markers.)

<a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1088">jpeg_set_marker_processor</a>() and <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1083">jpeg_save_markers</a>() are mutually exclusive
--- if you call one it overrides any previous call to the other, for the
particular marker type specified.

A simple example of an external COM processor can be found in djpeg.c.
Also, see jpegtran.c for an example of using <a href="jpeglib.h.html#L1083">jpeg_save_markers</a>.
